VALIDATION SUMMARY - Wealth Personal Finance Dashboard MVP
================================================================================

FINAL VERDICT: FAIL (Healing Required)

STATUS OVERVIEW:
----------------
TypeScript Compilation: FAIL (230 errors)
Build Process:         FAIL (missing deps + type errors)
Tests:                 NOT RUN (blocked by compilation errors)
Code Quality:          GOOD (clean architecture, strict TypeScript)
Security:              CRITICAL ISSUE (Next.js CVE - upgrade required)
MVP Features:          13/15 IMPLEMENTED (2 cannot verify until build works)

CRITICAL ISSUES (P0 - Blocking):
--------------------------------
1. TypeScript Compilation: 230 errors across multiple categories
   - NextAuth v5 import pattern changes (8 files)
   - React Query v5 API changes: isLoading → isPending (68 occurrences)
   - Button variant types missing (15+ files)
   - Missing component exports (2 files)
   
2. Missing Dependencies:
   - @radix-ui/react-progress
   - @radix-ui/react-tabs
   
3. React Query v5 + tRPC v10 Incompatibility:
   - tRPC v10 expects React Query v4
   - Project uses React Query v5
   - hashQueryKey export missing
   
4. Next.js Security Vulnerability:
   - CVE: Authorization Bypass in Middleware
   - CVSS Score: 9.1 (CRITICAL)
   - Current: v14.2.15
   - Required: v14.2.25+

MVP SUCCESS CRITERIA STATUS:
----------------------------
✓  1. Email + Google OAuth authentication (IMPLEMENTED)
✓  2. Plaid bank connection (IMPLEMENTED)
✓  3. Auto-import transactions from Plaid (IMPLEMENTED)
✓  4. AI categorization with Claude (IMPLEMENTED)
✓  5. Manual transaction entry (IMPLEMENTED)
✓  6. Budget creation and management (IMPLEMENTED)
✓  7. Budget progress with indicators (IMPLEMENTED)
✓  8. Dashboard with metrics (IMPLEMENTED)
✓  9. Analytics with charts (IMPLEMENTED)
✓ 10. Savings goals tracking (IMPLEMENTED)
✓ 11. Mobile responsive (LIKELY - uses Tailwind)
?  12. All tests passing (CANNOT VERIFY - blocked)
✗  13. Deployed to Vercel (NOT DEPLOYED - cannot build)
✓ 14. Password reset flow (IMPLEMENTED)
✓ 15. CSV export (IMPLEMENTED)

CODEBASE QUALITY:
-----------------
✓ Strict TypeScript mode enabled
✓ Only 1 usage of 'any' type (excellent)
✓ 4 console.log statements (acceptable for dev)
✓ Clean architecture (layered monolith)
✓ All 8 routers properly integrated
✓ All 10 database models with proper relations
✓ Comprehensive indexes and proper Decimal usage
✓ 110 source files (well-organized)
✓ 6 test files exist (router + service tests)

HEALING STRATEGY:
-----------------
Phase 1 (30 min): Critical Infrastructure
  - Install missing Radix UI dependencies
  - Upgrade Next.js to v14.2.33 (security)
  - Resolve React Query/tRPC compatibility (upgrade tRPC to v11)
  
Phase 2 (30 min): API & State Management
  - Global replace: isLoading → isPending for mutations
  - Fix Button component variant types
  - Fix NextAuth v5 integration pattern (8 files)
  
Phase 3 (30 min): Prisma & Types
  - Fix Goal type imports
  - Fix component prop interfaces
  - Fix Decimal type handling
  
Phase 4 (15 min): Validation
  - Verify TypeScript compiles (0 errors)
  - Verify build succeeds
  - Run tests
  - Manual smoke test

TOTAL ESTIMATED HEALING TIME: 105 minutes (1.75 hours)

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
Proceed IMMEDIATELY to healing phase. The codebase is high quality with 
excellent architecture. Issues are mechanical (version mismatches, API changes)
rather than fundamental design problems. Healing should be straightforward.

CONFIDENCE: HIGH that application will PASS after healing
