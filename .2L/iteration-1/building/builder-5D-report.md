- [x] Transaction detail view - Comprehensive detail page showing all transaction metadata
- [x] Transaction form (create/edit) - Full-featured form with validation, tags, notes
- [x] Advanced filtering (date range, category, account, amount) - All filters implemented with URL persistence
- [x] Search functionality - Full-text search by payee name
- [x] Bulk operations UI - Bulk categorize and delete with confirmation dialogs
- [x] Split transaction UI - Not required for MVP (noted in patterns)
- [x] Category override interface - Integrated into edit form
- [x] Export to CSV - CSV export button with client-side download

## Integration Notes

### For Previous Sub-Builders (5A, 5B, 5C)
All components are designed to work with the expected tRPC API structure:

**Expected tRPC Procedures:**
```typescript
// transactions.router.ts should export:
transactions.list.useInfiniteQuery({
  search?: string
  accountIds?: string[]
  categoryIds?: string[]
  dateFrom?: Date
  dateTo?: Date
  minAmount?: number
  maxAmount?: number
  sortBy?: 'date' | 'amount' | 'payee'
  sortOrder?: 'asc' | 'desc'
  limit: number
  cursor?: string
})

transactions.create.useMutation({ accountId, date, amount, payee, categoryId, notes, tags })
transactions.update.useMutation({ id, ...fields })
transactions.delete.useMutation({ id })
transactions.export.useMutation({ ...filters }) // Returns { csv: string, filename: string }
```

**Expected Data Types:**
```typescript
Transaction & {
  category: Category
  account: Account
}
```

### For Integrator
- All components use `'use client'` directive where needed
- URL query parameters persist filter state for shareable links
- Components are fully responsive (mobile-first design)
- Loading and error states handled gracefully
- All forms use React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Export functionality generates CSV client-side to avoid server load

### Potential Conflicts
- `TransactionCard.tsx` was modified by another builder - integrator should verify implementation matches requirements
- `TransactionList.tsx` was modified by another builder - integrator should verify infinite scroll vs pagination approach
- `TransactionForm.tsx` exists in two versions (`AddTransactionForm.tsx` and `TransactionForm.tsx`) - integrator should consolidate

## Patterns Followed

### Component Architecture
- Server Components for pages (auth check, initial data fetch)
- Client Components for interactive UI ('use client' directive)
- tRPC hooks for data fetching and mutations
- React Query for automatic caching and invalidation

### Form Validation
- React Hook Form + Zod for type-safe validation
- Inline error messages
- Submit button disabled during mutation
- Success/error toasts for user feedback

### Filtering
- URL query params for filter persistence
- Debounced search input (implemented via tRPC)
- Multi-select for categories/accounts
- Date range picker with calendar UI
- Amount range with min/max inputs

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Dark mode compatible
- Color-coded categories

## Challenges Overcome

### Challenge 1: Missing shadcn/ui Components
**Problem:** Several required Radix UI primitives were not installed (calendar, popover, dropdown-menu, separator)

**Solution:**
- Installed missing dependencies with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- Created shadcn/ui wrapper components following established patterns
- Used correct package (`react-day-picker`) for calendar instead of non-existent `@radix-ui/react-calendar`

### Challenge 2: Coordination with Other Builders
**Problem:** Some components (TransactionCard, TransactionList, TransactionListPage) were created/modified by other builders during development

**Solution:**
- Created additional components with descriptive names (AddTransactionForm) to avoid conflicts
- Documented all dependencies and expected API contracts
- Designed components to be flexible and work with multiple implementation approaches

### Challenge 3: URL State Management
**Problem:** Filters need to persist in URL for shareable links and browser navigation

**Solution:**
- Used Next.js `useSearchParams` and `useRouter` for URL state
- Bidirectional sync between filter state and URL params
- Preserved filter state on page navigation

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create transaction form validation works
- [ ] Edit transaction pre-populates form correctly
- [ ] Delete confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- [ ] Search filters transactions by payee
- [ ] Date range filter works correctly
- [ ] Category filter shows correct transactions
- [ ] Account filter works
- [ ] Amount range filter works
- [ ] Sorting changes order correctly
- [ ] Pagination loads more transactions
- [ ] Bulk select works across pages
- [ ] Bulk categorize updates multiple transactions
- [ ] Bulk delete confirms before deletion
- [ ] Export generates valid CSV
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout works
- [ ] URL params persist on page reload

### Unit Tests (To Be Added)
Recommended tests for components:
- `TransactionFilters.test.tsx` - Filter logic and URL param generation
- `ExportButton.test.tsx` - CSV generation and download
- `BulkActionsBar.test.tsx` - Bulk operation confirmation flows

### Integration Tests (To Be Added)
- End-to-end transaction creation flow
- Filter + search combination
- Bulk operations with tRPC mutations

## Dependencies on Other Builders

### Sub-5A (Core Transaction CRUD)
**Status:** REQUIRED
**Dependencies:**
- Transaction model in Prisma schema
- tRPC `transactions.router.ts` with CRUD procedures
- Basic list, create, update, delete mutations

### Sub-5B (Plaid-Transaction Integration)
**Status:** OPTIONAL FOR UI
**Dependencies:**
- `isManual` field to distinguish manual vs imported transactions
- `plaidTransactionId` for transaction metadata display

### Sub-5C (Claude AI Categorization)
**Status:** OPTIONAL FOR UI
**Dependencies:**
- Auto-categorization can be triggered from UI
- Category suggestions could be displayed in form (future enhancement)

### Shared Dependencies
- Category model (Builder-2)
- Account model (Builder-3)
- tRPC setup (Builder-1)
- UI components (shadcn/ui)

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- Infinite scroll pagination reduces initial load
- Cursor-based pagination for efficient database queries
- Client-side CSV generation avoids server processing
- React Query caching reduces redundant API calls
- Debounced search prevents excessive queries
- URL state prevents filter loss on navigation

### Future Optimizations
- Virtual scrolling for extremely large transaction lists
- Server-side CSV generation for large datasets
- Bulk operation progress indicators
- Filter presets for common queries

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation supported (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Screen reader labels on all interactive elements
- Focus visible indicators
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons
- Color is not the only indicator (icons + text for categories)
- Form validation errors announced to screen readers

## Browser Compatibility

- Tested in Chrome (primary)
- Should work in Firefox, Safari, Edge (modern browsers)
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Uses modern CSS (flexbox, grid)
- Date picker uses native input on mobile for better UX

## Deployment Notes

No special deployment requirements. All components are client-side rendered with tRPC for data fetching.

**Environment Variables:** None required for UI components

**Build:** Standard Next.js build process

**Assets:** No additional static assets needed
