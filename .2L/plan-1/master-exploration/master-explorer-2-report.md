## Focus Area
Dependencies & Risk Assessment

## Vision Summary
Transform the Wealth app's UX to embody a "conscious money relationship" through emotional warmth, add critical infrastructure (user roles, currency switching), and restructure settings for clarity and future monetization.

---

## Requirements Analysis

### Scope Assessment
- **Total features identified:** 5 major features (Currency System, User Roles, Settings Restructure, Dashboard UX, Visual Polish)
- **User stories/acceptance criteria:** 60+ acceptance criteria across all features
- **Estimated total work:** 18-24 hours

### Complexity Rating
**Overall Complexity: COMPLEX**

**Rationale:**
- **Full-stack scope:** Requires changes across database schema, backend APIs, middleware, frontend UI, and styling
- **Data migration risk:** Currency conversion affects ALL financial data (transactions, accounts, budgets, goals) - high stakes
- **Infrastructure changes:** Adding role-based access control touches auth middleware, routing, and navigation
- **UX transformation:** Not just new features - requires redesigning existing components and interaction patterns
- **External API dependency:** Currency conversion requires reliable exchange rate API integration
- **Transactional integrity:** Currency conversion must be all-or-nothing (no partial failures allowed)

---

## Architectural Analysis

### Major Components Identified

1. **Currency Conversion System**
   - **Purpose:** Enable users to switch currency system-wide with automatic conversion of all financial data
   - **Complexity:** HIGH
   - **Why critical:** Affects every financial record in the system; failure corrupts user data; requires transactional integrity

2. **User Role & Tier Infrastructure**
   - **Purpose:** Add RBAC (role-based access control) and subscription tier foundation for future monetization
   - **Complexity:** MEDIUM
   - **Why critical:** Foundation for future growth; touches authentication, authorization, and routing; must be secure

3. **Settings/Account Navigation Split**
   - **Purpose:** Separate system settings from personal account management for clarity
   - **Complexity:** MEDIUM
   - **Why critical:** Improves user experience and sets up for future billing integration; requires routing changes

4. **Dashboard UX Reordering**
   - **Purpose:** Lead with emotional support (affirmation) before showing financial data
   - **Complexity:** LOW-MEDIUM
   - **Why critical:** Core to "conscious money" positioning; affects first impression of entire app

5. **Visual Warmth Layer**
   - **Purpose:** Soften UI throughout (typography, colors, animations, shadows) to match mindful positioning
   - **Complexity:** MEDIUM
   - **Why critical:** Pervasive change affecting every component; must be consistent; impacts design system

6. **Admin Dashboard & User Management**
   - **Purpose:** View system metrics and manage users (admin-only)
   - **Complexity:** LOW-MEDIUM
   - **Why critical:** Enables platform management; simpler than other features but requires secure access control

### Technology Stack Implications

**Database (PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM)**
- **Options:** Existing setup with schema migrations
- **Recommendation:** Continue with Prisma - already well-integrated
- **Rationale:** Migration scripts handle schema changes (add role/tier enums); transactional support for currency conversion

**Exchange Rate API**
- **Options:** exchangerate.host (free), exchangerate-api.com (free tier), Open Exchange Rates (paid)
- **Recommendation:** exchangerate-api.com (free tier: 1,500 requests/month)
- **Rationale:** Reliable, simple API, historical rates available, sufficient for MVP (currency changes are infrequent)

**Authentication & Authorization**
- **Options:** Extend existing Supabase Auth with role checks
- **Recommendation:** Add role enum to User model + middleware authorization checks
- **Rationale:** Leverages existing auth; minimal new dependencies; secure server-side checks

**Animation & Visual Polish**
- **Options:** Framer Motion (already installed), custom CSS transitions
- **Recommendation:** Use Framer Motion for complex animations, CSS for simple transitions
- **Rationale:** Already in dependencies; battle-tested; good performance

---

## Iteration Breakdown Recommendation

### Recommendation: MULTI-ITERATION (3 phases)

**Rationale:**
- **Too complex for single iteration:** 60+ acceptance criteria across 5 major features spanning full stack
- **Natural dependency phases:** Infrastructure must be built before UI enhancements can reference it
- **Risk management:** Isolating high-risk currency conversion allows focused testing before moving forward
- **Progressive delivery:** Each iteration delivers standalone value; can pause/adjust between phases

---

### Suggested Iteration Phases

**Iteration 1: Foundation & Infrastructure**
- **Vision:** Establish role-based access, admin capabilities, and navigation structure
- **Scope:** Backend infrastructure changes that other features depend on
  - Add `role` and `subscriptionTier` enums to User model (database migration)
  - Set ahiya.butman@gmail.com as ADMIN via migration script
  - Create admin middleware for route protection
  - Build admin dashboard at `/admin` with system metrics (total users, transactions, activity)
  - Build user management page at `/admin/users` with search/filter
  - Split Settings/Account navigation:
    - Create `/settings` overview page (replaces direct jump to `/settings/categories`)
    - Create `/account` section with subsections (profile, membership, security, preferences)
    - Update sidebar navigation (Settings goes to overview)
    - Add avatar dropdown with Account menu
  - Update middleware to protect `/admin` routes (server-side, not just client-side)
  - Update tRPC users router to include role/tier in queries
- **Why first:** All other features depend on this foundation
  - Currency settings page needs the new Settings structure
  - Dashboard and UI polish need user role info for admin badge display
  - Future billing integration depends on subscription tier structure
- **Estimated duration:** 6-8 hours
- **Risk level:** MEDIUM
  - Database migration risk (test thoroughly, ensure rollback path)
  - Auth middleware changes could break existing routes if not careful
  - Admin-only routes must be truly secure (server-side validation critical)
- **Success criteria:**
  - Admin user can access `/admin` and see accurate metrics
  - Non-admin users redirected from `/admin` routes
  - Settings and Account sections navigable and distinct
  - All existing features still work (regression testing)

**Dependencies from existing system:**
- Requires: Supabase Auth, Prisma User model, existing middleware structure
- Imports: tRPC context (ctx.user), existing protected procedures pattern
- Extends: Navigation sidebar, dashboard layout

---

**Iteration 2: Currency Switching System**
- **Vision:** Enable safe, reliable currency conversion with full data integrity
- **Scope:** Complete currency conversion feature (highest risk, needs focus)
  - Create `ExchangeRate` model in Prisma schema
  - Create `CurrencyConversionLog` model for audit trail
  - Build currency settings page at `/settings/currency`
  - Integrate exchange rate API (exchangerate-api.com)
  - Build currency conversion service:
    - Fetch historical exchange rates for transaction dates
    - Cache rates in `ExchangeRate` table
    - Convert all transactions, accounts, budgets, goals in single transaction
    - Handle rollback on any failure
  - Create conversion UI:
    - Currency selector with major currencies
    - Confirmation dialog with clear warning
    - Progress indicator during conversion
    - Success/error feedback
  - Update tRPC users router with currency conversion procedures
  - Add currency conversion to Settings navigation
  - Edge case handling:
    - API timeout/failure (use fallback rates, warn if stale)
    - Mid-conversion navigation (show persistent notification)
    - Conversion in progress prevention (lock mechanism)
- **Dependencies:** Iteration 1 components
  - Requires: Settings structure from Iteration 1 (new page at `/settings/currency`)
  - Imports: User model with existing currency field
  - Extends: User settings pages
- **Estimated duration:** 7-9 hours
- **Risk level:** HIGH
  - **Data integrity risk:** Currency conversion must be transactional (all-or-nothing)
  - **External API risk:** Exchange rate API could be down, rate-limited, or return stale data
  - **Performance risk:** Converting 1000+ transactions could be slow (need progress feedback)
  - **Rollback risk:** Must safely undo conversion if anything fails mid-process
- **Success criteria:**
  - User can successfully convert all data to new currency
  - Conversion completes in <30 seconds for 1000 transactions
  - Failed conversions roll back completely (no partial state)
  - All amounts display in new currency throughout app
  - Exchange rates cached to avoid repeated API calls

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Use Prisma transactions (`$transaction`) to ensure atomic operations
- Implement retry logic for API calls (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Cache exchange rates aggressively (24-hour TTL minimum)
- Show clear progress UI (prevent user from leaving during conversion)
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Optional: Store original amounts for 30-day reversal window

---

**Iteration 3: Dashboard UX Transformation & Visual Polish**
- **Vision:** Soften the entire app to embody "conscious money relationship" positioning
- **Scope:** Frontend UX improvements and visual design refinement
  - **Dashboard reordering:**
    - Enlarge affirmation card (1.5x size, center-aligned)
    - Move greeting below affirmation (not above stats)
    - Create financial health indicator component (gentle gauge, supportive language)
    - Reorder: Affirmation → Greeting → Health Indicator → Transactions → Stats
    - Add fade-in animation (500ms, smooth entrance)
  - **Visual warmth system-wide:**
    - Update Tailwind config: Add rounded corners globally, soften shadows, expand color palette
    - Typography refinement: Serif headings, reduce number sizes, increase line-height
    - Color expansion: Keep sage/warm-gray, add terracotta, dusty blue, muted gold
    - Micro-interactions: Gentle hover states (scale 1.02), smooth transitions (200-300ms)
    - Consistent PageTransition component usage
    - Optional: Subtle paper texture on cards
  - **Component updates:**
    - Update all cards, buttons, inputs with new design tokens
    - Update DashboardStats component (moved lower, optional detail)
    - Update RecentTransactionsCard (maintain prominence)
    - Update sidebar (subscription tier badge in user info)
  - **Affirmation system:**
    - Daily rotation logic (one affirmation per day, not random per load)
    - Larger, more prominent display
    - Softer background styling
- **Dependencies:** Iteration 1 components
  - Requires: User model with subscription tier (for badge display)
  - Imports: Existing dashboard components (DashboardStats, RecentTransactionsCard, AffirmationCard)
  - Extends: Design system (Tailwind config, component library)
- **Estimated duration:** 5-7 hours
- **Risk level:** LOW-MEDIUM
  - **Subjective risk:** "Warmth" is subjective - needs user validation
  - **Consistency risk:** Design changes must be applied consistently across all components
  - **Performance risk:** Animations could impact performance on low-end devices (test thoroughly)
- **Success criteria:**
  - Dashboard prioritizes affirmation (first visible content on load)
  - All sharp borders replaced with rounded corners and soft shadows
  - Smooth transitions on all interactive elements
  - App feels noticeably warmer/gentler than before (subjective but critical)
  - No performance degradation (test on mobile devices)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

- **Currency Conversion Data Integrity**
  - **Impact:** Failed conversion could corrupt all financial data; user loses trust; data potentially unrecoverable
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Use database transactions (Prisma `$transaction`) for atomic operations
    - Implement comprehensive rollback logic
    - Test extensively with sample datasets (10, 100, 1000, 10000 transactions)
    - Consider storing original amounts for 30-day reversal window
    - Add conversion dry-run mode (preview only, no commit)
  - **Recommendation:** Tackle in dedicated iteration (Iteration 2) with focused testing

- **Exchange Rate API Reliability**
  - **Impact:** API downtime prevents currency conversion; stale rates cause inaccurate conversions
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Cache rates aggressively (24-hour TTL minimum)
    - Implement fallback to secondary API (e.g., backup manual rates)
    - Show clear warnings if rates are stale (>7 days old)
    - Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
    - Consider pre-fetching common currency pairs daily (background job)
  - **Recommendation:** Build robust error handling from day one; plan for API failures

- **Admin Route Security**
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to admin panel exposes sensitive user data; security breach
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Server-side role checks in middleware (not just client-side hidden UI)
    - Test unauthorized access attempts explicitly
    - Log all admin actions for audit trail
    - Consider IP whitelisting for admin routes (future enhancement)
  - **Recommendation:** Security review after Iteration 1; penetration testing

### Medium Risks

- **Database Migration Failures**
  - **Impact:** Adding role/tier enums could fail; existing data might not migrate cleanly
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Write migration scripts carefully (test on local DB first)
    - Ensure default values for new fields (USER role, FREE tier)
    - Backup production database before migration
    - Have rollback script ready
  - **Recommendation:** Test migrations on staging environment; rollback plan documented

- **Navigation Restructure Confusion**
  - **Impact:** Users expect Settings at `/settings/categories` (old behavior); new `/settings` overview could confuse
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Redirect old routes to new structure (e.g., `/settings/categories` stays, `/settings` becomes overview)
    - Clear breadcrumbs on all settings/account pages
    - User communication (changelog, in-app notification about new structure)
  - **Recommendation:** A/B test with small user group if possible; gather feedback

- **Performance Degradation from Animations**
  - **Impact:** Smooth transitions could slow down app on low-end devices; poor mobile experience
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Test on mid-range Android devices (not just high-end desktops)
    - Use CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated) over layout-shifting animations
    - Add `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support
    - Limit animation complexity (no heavy JavaScript-driven animations)
  - **Recommendation:** Performance testing required; budget 10% iteration time for optimization

### Low Risks

- **Affirmation Daily Rotation Logic:** Simple date-based selection; low complexity; worst case is repeated affirmation
- **Subscription Tier Badge Display:** Cosmetic feature; no data integrity concerns; easy to fix if styling breaks
- **Admin Dashboard Metrics Accuracy:** Read-only data; no mutation risk; slow queries at worst (can optimize later)

---

## Integration Considerations

### Cross-Phase Integration Points

- **User Model:** Central to all iterations
  - Iteration 1 adds `role` and `subscriptionTier` fields
  - Iteration 2 uses existing `currency` field (no new fields, just conversion logic)
  - Iteration 3 reads `subscriptionTier` for badge display
  - **Integration risk:** LOW - all read existing data, minimal conflict

- **Settings Navigation Structure:** Shared across iterations
  - Iteration 1 creates `/settings` overview and `/settings/currency` placeholder
  - Iteration 2 builds out `/settings/currency` page
  - **Integration risk:** LOW - clear separation of concerns

- **tRPC Users Router:** Extended in multiple iterations
  - Iteration 1 updates `me` query to include role/tier
  - Iteration 2 adds currency conversion procedures
  - **Integration risk:** LOW - additive changes, no breaking modifications

- **Middleware:** Critical shared component
  - Iteration 1 adds admin route protection
  - Iteration 2 and 3 don't modify middleware
  - **Integration risk:** LOW - Iteration 1 establishes pattern, others follow

### Potential Integration Challenges

- **Design System Consistency (Iteration 3):** Visual polish must be applied consistently across all components (including those from Iterations 1 and 2)
  - **Challenge:** If Iteration 3 happens weeks after Iterations 1-2, new components might not match visual style
  - **Mitigation:** Document design tokens (colors, spacing, shadows) in Iteration 1; apply to new components immediately

- **Currency Display After Conversion (Iteration 2):** All components must respect user's currency preference
  - **Challenge:** Existing components might hardcode USD symbol or format
  - **Mitigation:** Audit all currency display logic; create shared formatting utility function

- **Admin Navigation Visibility (Iteration 1 + 3):** Admin nav item must check role (Iteration 1) and style consistently (Iteration 3)
  - **Challenge:** Styling changes in Iteration 3 might break admin UI if not careful
  - **Mitigation:** Include admin pages in visual audit during Iteration 3

---

## Recommendations for Master Plan

1. **Prioritize Iteration 1 (Foundation) as critical path**
   - Cannot proceed with Iterations 2 or 3 until foundation is solid
   - Allocate extra time for thorough testing (auth, routing, migrations)
   - Consider this the "blocking" iteration

2. **Isolate Iteration 2 (Currency) as high-risk, focused effort**
   - Do not combine with other features (too much risk)
   - Allocate 20% extra time for edge case testing
   - Consider adding dry-run/preview mode before committing conversion
   - Plan for post-iteration monitoring (watch for conversion failures in production)

3. **Iterations 2 and 3 can run in parallel (if resources allow)**
   - No dependencies between currency system and visual polish
   - Both depend only on Iteration 1
   - Could save 1-2 days if building simultaneously (not recommended for solo developer)

4. **Consider Iteration 3 as "optional refinement" for MVP**
   - If time-constrained, Iterations 1 and 2 deliver core functionality
   - Iteration 3 is UX polish (important but less critical than infrastructure)
   - Could defer to post-MVP if needed (but loses "conscious money" positioning impact)

5. **Plan for post-iteration validation between each phase**
   - After Iteration 1: Test admin access, verify migrations, check routing
   - After Iteration 2: Test currency conversion with real-world data volumes, monitor API usage
   - After Iteration 3: User feedback on "warmth" perception, performance testing

6. **Budget 15% contingency time per iteration**
   - Complex projects often encounter unexpected issues
   - Better to finish early than scramble at deadline
   - Total estimated time: 18-24 hours + 3-4 hours contingency = 21-28 hours realistic

## Technology Recommendations

### Existing Codebase Findings

- **Stack detected:** Next.js 14 (App Router), Prisma ORM, tRPC, Supabase Auth, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Framer Motion
- **Patterns observed:**
  - Strong separation: tRPC routers for API, server components for pages, client components for interactivity
  - Auth: Supabase-based, middleware handles protected routes
  - Database: Prisma with migrations, good schema structure
  - UI: shadcn/ui components (Radix UI + Tailwind), consistent styling
  - Plaid integration exists (53+ references) - be careful not to break financial data sync

- **Opportunities:**
  - Existing Framer Motion dependency (already installed) - leverage for animations
  - Strong tRPC patterns - follow for new routers (admin, currency)
  - Middleware structure is clean - easy to extend for admin checks
  - Component library established - reuse patterns for new UI

- **Constraints:**
  - Must maintain Supabase Auth integration (don't introduce new auth system)
  - Must preserve Plaid sync (currency conversion could affect synced transactions - test thoroughly)
  - Currency field already exists on User model (good!) but hardcoded USD displays might be scattered
  - Navigation currently jumps to `/settings/categories` (line 60 in DashboardSidebar.tsx) - needs update

### Greenfield Recommendations
(N/A - this is brownfield/extending existing codebase)

## Critical Path Identification

**Critical path (must complete in order):**

1. **Database Schema Changes** (Iteration 1, ~1 hour)
   - Blocks: Everything else
   - Risk: MEDIUM (migration could fail)

2. **Admin Middleware & Route Protection** (Iteration 1, ~2 hours)
   - Blocks: Admin dashboard, admin user management
   - Risk: MEDIUM (security-critical)

3. **Settings/Account Navigation Split** (Iteration 1, ~3 hours)
   - Blocks: Currency settings page (Iteration 2), visual polish consistency (Iteration 3)
   - Risk: LOW (mostly routing and UI)

4. **Currency Conversion Service** (Iteration 2, ~4-5 hours)
   - Blocks: Currency UI, testing, rollout
   - Risk: HIGH (data integrity)

**Non-critical path (can parallelize):**
- Admin dashboard UI (Iteration 1) - not blocking
- Dashboard UX reordering (Iteration 3) - not blocking
- Visual polish (Iteration 3) - not blocking after Iteration 1 completes

**Estimated critical path duration:** 10-11 hours (minimum time to deliver core functionality)
**Full project duration (all 3 iterations):** 18-24 hours (realistic with testing)

---

## Feature Dependency Matrix

| Feature | Depends On | Blocks | Can Parallelize With |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| Database Schema (role/tier) | None | Everything in Iteration 1 | None |
| Admin Middleware | Schema changes | Admin dashboard, admin routes | None |
| Admin Dashboard | Middleware | None | Settings split, Visual polish |
| Settings/Account Split | None | Currency page (Iteration 2) | Admin dashboard |
| Currency Conversion System | Settings split | None | Dashboard UX, Visual polish |
| Dashboard UX Transformation | User model (tier field) | None | Currency system |
| Visual Polish | User model (tier field) | None | Currency system, Dashboard UX |

---

## Notes & Observations

**Existing codebase strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns (server/client, API/UI)
- Strong typing with TypeScript and Zod validation
- Good test coverage infrastructure (Vitest configured)
- Established design system (Tailwind + Radix UI)
- Mature financial data model (accounts, transactions, budgets, goals)

**Existing codebase gaps (addressed by this vision):**
- No role-based access control (adding in Iteration 1)
- Currency hardcoded (fixing in Iteration 2)
- Settings navigation confusing (fixing in Iteration 1)
- UX lacks emotional warmth (fixing in Iteration 3)

**Open questions requiring resolution:**
1. Should currency conversion be reversible? (Store original amounts for 30 days?) - Recommend YES for safety
2. Do we need admin audit logs for all actions? - Recommend YES for currency conversions, OPTIONAL for general admin actions
3. Should affirmations be time-based (morning/evening different)? - Recommend DAILY rotation (simpler) for MVP, enhance later
4. When user changes currency, should we send confirmation email? - Recommend YES (important action, user should know)
5. Should financial health indicator be simple or granular? - Recommend SIMPLE ("On track" / "Needs attention") for MVP

**Recommended decision before starting Iteration 2:**
- Choose exchange rate API provider (recommend exchangerate-api.com free tier)
- Decide on currency reversal window (recommend 30 days)
- Define acceptable conversion time (recommend <30 seconds for 1000 transactions, show progress)
