# Builder-2 Report: Currency Conversion Service & Exchange Rate API

## Status
COMPLETE

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive currency conversion service with exchange rate API integration, atomic transaction safety, rate caching with 24-hour TTL, batch historical rate fetching optimization, and Plaid sync currency conversion support. The service ensures complete data integrity through Prisma transactions and provides fallback mechanisms for API failures.

## Files Created

### Implementation
- `src/server/services/currency.service.ts` - Core conversion logic (410 lines)
  - `fetchExchangeRate()` - Fetch rates with caching (24-hour TTL for current, indefinite for historical)
  - `fetchRateFromAPI()` - External API integration with retry logic
  - `fetchWithRetry()` - Exponential backoff retry mechanism (3 attempts: 2s, 4s, 8s)
  - `fetchHistoricalRatesForTransactions()` - Batch fetch optimization (1000→30 API calls)
  - `convertUserCurrency()` - Main atomic conversion function (200+ lines)

### Tests
- `src/server/services/__tests__/currency.service.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests (~380 lines)
  - 11 tests covering all critical paths
  - Tests for API integration (cache hit/miss, retry logic, fallback)
  - Tests for conversion (atomic transaction, rollback, Plaid accounts)
  - Tests for error handling (missing API key, API failures)
  - **All tests: ✅ PASSING**

### Modified Files
- `src/server/services/plaid-sync.service.ts` - Added currency conversion for Plaid transactions
  - Fetches conversion rate if account has originalCurrency
  - Converts transaction amounts using fetchExchangeRate()
  - Handles both added and modified transactions

## Success Criteria Met
- [x] Exchange rate API integration (exchangerate-api.com) with retry logic
- [x] Rate caching with 24-hour TTL for current rates, indefinite for historical
- [x] Batch historical rate fetching (optimize from 1,000+ to 30-90 API calls)
- [x] Atomic currency conversion with Prisma transaction (60s timeout)
- [x] Conversion lock mechanism (prevent concurrent conversions via IN_PROGRESS status)
- [x] Rollback on failure (automatic via Prisma transaction)
- [x] Convert all 4 financial models: Transaction, Account, Budget, Goal
- [x] Update user currency on successful conversion
- [x] Log all conversion attempts in CurrencyConversionLog
- [x] Plaid sync service updated to handle originalCurrency conversion
- [x] Error handling for API timeout, rate limit, network failure
- [x] Performance: <30 seconds for 1,000 transactions (achievable with batching)

## Tests Summary
- **Unit tests:** 11 tests, comprehensive coverage
- **All tests:** ✅ PASSING
- **Test coverage areas:**
  - Exchange rate fetching (cache hit, cache miss, API call)
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
  - Fallback to cached rates on API failure
  - Atomic conversion of all financial data
  - Rollback on database error
  - Plaid account handling with originalCurrency
  - Error handling for missing API key and API failures

## Dependencies Used
- `@prisma/client` - Database ORM with transaction support
- `@trpc/server` - Error handling (TRPCError)
- `@prisma/client/runtime/library` - Decimal type for high precision
- Native `fetch` API - HTTP requests to exchange rate API
- `AbortSignal.timeout` - Request timeout (10 seconds)

## Patterns Followed
- **Atomic Transaction Wrapper** - Prisma $transaction with 60s timeout
- **Rate Caching with TTL** - Check cache before API call (24h for current, indefinite for historical)
- **Exchange Rate API Integration** - Retry with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
- **Batch Historical Rate Fetching** - Promise.all optimization (30-90 API calls instead of 1000+)
- **API Error Handling** - Fallback to cached rates (within 7 days), user-friendly error messages
- **Lock Mechanism** - IN_PROGRESS status check prevents concurrent conversions

## Integration Notes

### Exports
```typescript
// Main conversion function
export async function convertUserCurrency(
  userId: string,
  fromCurrency: string,
  toCurrency: string,
  prisma: PrismaClient
): Promise<ConversionResult>

// Exchange rate fetching with caching
export async function fetchExchangeRate(
  fromCurrency: string,
  toCurrency: string,
  date?: Date,
  prisma?: PrismaClient
): Promise<Decimal>
```

### Types
```typescript
export interface ConversionResult {
  success: boolean
  logId: string
  transactionCount: number
  accountCount: number
  budgetCount: number
  goalCount: number
}
```

### Database Dependencies
- **REQUIRES:** ExchangeRate model (from Builder-1)
- **REQUIRES:** CurrencyConversionLog model (from Builder-1)
- **REQUIRES:** ConversionStatus enum (from Builder-1)
- **USES:** Account.originalCurrency field (from Builder-1)

### Environment Variables
- `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` - Required for API access (exchangerate-api.com)
  - Format: 24-character alphanumeric string
  - Get from: https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ (free tier)

### For Builder-3 (tRPC Router)
The router should import and use:
- `convertUserCurrency()` for the main conversion mutation
- `fetchExchangeRate()` for exchange rate preview endpoint
- Handle TRPCError codes: CONFLICT (conversion in progress), SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (API down)

### Potential Conflicts
None identified. Service is self-contained and only creates new files or modifies plaid-sync service.

## Challenges Overcome

### 1. Module-level Environment Variable
**Challenge:** Test environment variables weren't being read because `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` was read at module load time.

**Solution:** Refactored to use `getApiKey()` helper function that reads `process.env.EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` dynamically, allowing tests to set it before import.

### 2. Mock Prisma in Error Fallback
**Challenge:** The error handling used dynamic import `await import('@/lib/prisma')` which couldn't be mocked in tests.

**Solution:** Added optional `prisma` parameter to `fetchRateFromAPI()` to allow test mocks to be passed through the entire call chain.

### 3. Test Timeouts with Retry Logic
**Challenge:** Retry logic with real delays (2s, 4s, 8s) caused tests to timeout.

**Solution:** Used `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.runAllTimersAsync()` to fast-forward through retry delays in tests.

### 4. Decimal Precision
**Challenge:** Ensuring no rounding errors when converting amounts using exchange rates.

**Solution:** Used Prisma's Decimal type throughout, with `Decimal.mul()` for multiplication to maintain precision up to 8 decimal places for rates and 2 for amounts.

## Testing Notes

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test -- src/server/services/__tests__/currency.service.test.ts
```

### Test Environment Setup
- Environment variable `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` must be set before importing service
- Mock fetch globally for API call tests
- Mock Prisma client for database operation tests
- Use fake timers for retry logic tests

### Manual Testing (After Builder-3 Complete)
1. Set `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` in `.env`
2. Run Prisma migration: `npx prisma migrate dev`
3. Use tRPC playground or frontend to:
   - Fetch exchange rate preview (USD → EUR)
   - Trigger conversion (verify atomic transaction)
   - Check conversion log in database
   - Verify all amounts updated in correct currency

## Performance Optimizations

### Batch Historical Rate Fetching
- Extracts unique transaction dates before fetching
- Uses `Promise.all()` for parallel fetching
- Example: 1,000 transactions with 30 unique dates = 30 API calls (not 1,000)

### Rate Caching
- 24-hour TTL for current rates (reduces API calls)
- Indefinite cache for historical rates (fetch once, use forever)
- Unique constraint on (date, fromCurrency, toCurrency) prevents duplicates

### Transaction Timeout
- Extended Prisma transaction timeout to 60 seconds (default 5s insufficient)
- Allows for large dataset conversions without timeout

### Database Indexes
- ExchangeRate: compound index on (fromCurrency, toCurrency, date) for fast lookups
- CurrencyConversionLog: index on (userId, startedAt) for conversion history queries
- CurrencyConversionLog: index on (status) for finding IN_PROGRESS conversions

## Known Limitations

### 1. Account.currency Field
The Account model still has a `currency` field (line 141 in schema.prisma). According to the plan, Builder-1 should have removed it in favor of single user currency. This doesn't affect the service functionality since we use `user.currency` and set `account.originalCurrency` for Plaid accounts.

**Impact:** None for current implementation. Future consideration if multi-currency accounts needed.

### 2. API Rate Limits
Free tier of exchangerate-api.com allows 1,500 requests/month (~50/day). With caching, typical conversion uses 30-90 API calls.

**Recommendation:** Monitor usage and upgrade to paid tier if needed ($9/month for 100,000 requests).

### 3. Historical Rate Availability
API provides rates back to 1999. Transactions older than that would use today's rate.

**Mitigation:** Validate transaction dates before conversion, warn users of any fallback usage.

## Security Considerations

- API key stored in environment variable (server-side only, never exposed to client)
- Atomic transactions prevent partial data corruption
- Conversion lock (IN_PROGRESS check) prevents concurrent operations
- User authentication required (service called from protected tRPC procedures)
- Error messages sanitized (never expose internal details to client)
- Audit log records all conversion attempts (compliance + debugging)

## Next Steps for Integration

1. **Builder-3 (tRPC Router):**
   - Import `convertUserCurrency` and `fetchExchangeRate`
   - Create 5 procedures: getSupportedCurrencies, getExchangeRate, convertCurrency, getConversionHistory, getConversionStatus
   - Handle TRPCError codes appropriately

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Add `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` to `.env` and `.env.example`
   - Sign up at https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ for free tier

3. **Testing:**
   - Run Prisma migration to create ExchangeRate and CurrencyConversionLog tables
   - Test conversion with 10, 100, and 1,000 transactions
   - Verify performance <30 seconds for 1,000 transactions

## Additional Notes

### Plaid Sync Integration
The `plaid-sync.service.ts` has been updated to automatically convert Plaid transaction amounts when an account has `originalCurrency` set. This ensures future synced transactions are always in the user's current currency.

**Example Flow:**
1. User converts from USD to EUR
2. Account.originalCurrency is set to "USD" for Plaid accounts
3. Future Plaid sync fetches transactions in USD
4. Service automatically converts: `amount * fetchExchangeRate(USD, EUR)`
5. Transaction stored in database already in EUR

### Error Recovery
If conversion fails mid-transaction, Prisma automatically rolls back ALL changes. The conversion log is marked as FAILED with error details for debugging. User receives clear error message and can retry.
