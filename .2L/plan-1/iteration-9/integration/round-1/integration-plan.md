## Integration Zones

### Zone 1: Database Foundation Layer

**Builders involved:** Builder-1

**Conflict type:** None (Foundation layer)

**Risk level:** LOW

**Description:**
Builder-1 created the complete database schema for currency conversion including ExchangeRate caching model, CurrencyConversionLog audit trail, and Account.originalCurrency field. Migration has been applied to local database and verified. This is the foundation for all other builders with zero conflicts.

**Files affected:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added 2 new models (ExchangeRate, CurrencyConversionLog), 1 enum (ConversionStatus), modified Account model
- `prisma/migrations/20251003000156_add_currency_conversion_models/migration.sql` - Database migration
- `prisma/migrations/20251003000156_add_currency_conversion_models/ROLLBACK.md` - Rollback documentation

**Integration strategy:**
1. Verify migration marked as applied in local database (`npx prisma migrate status`)
2. Confirm Prisma Client regenerated with new types (import test: `import { ConversionStatus } from '@prisma/client'`)
3. Validate all indexes created correctly (5 indexes across 2 tables)
4. No merge conflicts - Builder-1 is sole owner of Prisma schema changes

**Expected outcome:**
- Database schema includes ExchangeRate, CurrencyConversionLog models
- ConversionStatus enum available for import
- Account.originalCurrency field exists (nullable)
- Migration status shows "Database schema is up to date"

**Assigned to:** Integrator-1

**Estimated complexity:** LOW

---

### Zone 2: Service Layer with Database Integration

**Builders involved:** Builder-2 (depends on Builder-1)

**Conflict type:** Shared types (imports Builder-1's Prisma types)

**Risk level:** LOW

**Description:**
Builder-2 created the currency conversion service with exchange rate API integration, rate caching, atomic transaction handling, and Plaid sync updates. Successfully imports and uses all Prisma types from Builder-1's schema. No conflicts - only creates new service files.

**Files affected:**
- `src/server/services/currency.service.ts` - Core conversion logic (410 lines)
- `src/server/services/__tests__/currency.service.test.ts` - Unit tests (380 lines)
- `src/server/services/plaid-sync.service.ts` - Modified to handle originalCurrency conversion

**Integration strategy:**
1. Verify service imports work: `import { ExchangeRate, CurrencyConversionLog, ConversionStatus } from '@prisma/client'`
2. Confirm all 11 unit tests passing
3. Validate environment variable EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY documented
4. Check Plaid sync modification doesn't break existing sync logic
5. No merge conflicts - Builder-2 creates new files, minimal modification to plaid-sync.service.ts

**Expected outcome:**
- currency.service.ts exports: convertUserCurrency(), fetchExchangeRate()
- All tests passing (11/11)
- Plaid sync handles currency conversion when originalCurrency set
- Service layer ready for tRPC router consumption

**Assigned to:** Integrator-1

**Estimated complexity:** LOW

---

### Zone 3: tRPC Router Integration

**Builders involved:** Builder-3 (depends on Builder-2)

**Conflict type:** Shared file modification (root.ts), Shared constants (constants.ts)

**Risk level:** MEDIUM

**Description:**
Builder-3 created the tRPC currency router with 5 procedures and successfully integrated with Builder-2's service layer. Two shared files require merge attention: root.ts (add currency router) and constants.ts (SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES constant).

**Files affected:**
- `src/server/api/routers/currency.router.ts` - Main currency router (235 lines)
- `src/server/api/routers/__tests__/currency.router.test.ts` - Unit tests (338 lines)
- `src/server/api/root.ts` - MODIFIED: Added currencyRouter to appRouter (2 lines)
- `src/lib/constants.ts` - MODIFIED: Added SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES constant (15 lines)
- `src/types/currency.ts` - Type definitions (48 lines)

**Integration strategy:**
1. **root.ts merge:**
   - Builder-3 added: `import { currencyRouter } from './routers/currency.router'`
   - Builder-3 added: `currency: currencyRouter,` to appRouter
   - Check for conflicts with other router additions (unlikely in isolated iteration)
   - Merge is simple 2-line addition

2. **constants.ts merge:**
   - Builder-3 added SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES array (10 currencies)
   - Check if file exists, if not, entire addition is clean
   - If exists, append to end of file (no conflicts expected)

3. **Verify integration:**
   - Import service functions work: `import { fetchExchangeRate, convertUserCurrency } from '@/server/services/currency.service'`
   - All 21 unit tests passing
   - TypeScript compiles with no errors
   - tRPC router accessible at trpc.currency.*

**Expected outcome:**
- Currency router registered in appRouter
- SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES constant available
- All 5 procedures functional (getSupportedCurrencies, getExchangeRate, convertCurrency, getConversionHistory, getConversionStatus)
- 21/21 tests passing
- Clean ESLint (0 errors, 0 warnings)

**Assigned to:** Integrator-1

**Estimated complexity:** MEDIUM (due to shared file modifications)

---

### Zone 4: UI Components with tRPC Integration

**Builders involved:** Builder-4 (depends on Builder-3)

**Conflict type:** Shared utilities (utils.ts modification)

**Risk level:** LOW

**Description:**
Builder-4 created 4 currency UI components and successfully integrated with Builder-3's tRPC procedures. One shared file requires attention: utils.ts (added getCurrencySymbol and getCurrencyName helper functions).

**Files affected:**
- `src/components/currency/CurrencySelector.tsx` - Main currency selector (162 lines)
- `src/components/currency/CurrencyConfirmationDialog.tsx` - Warning dialog (147 lines)
- `src/components/currency/CurrencyConversionProgress.tsx` - Progress indicator (144 lines)
- `src/components/currency/CurrencyConversionSuccess.tsx` - Success summary (98 lines)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/currency/page.tsx` - MODIFIED: Replaced placeholder with CurrencySelector (22 lines)
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - MODIFIED: Added getCurrencySymbol() and getCurrencyName() helpers (45 lines total, +31 new)

**Integration strategy:**
1. **utils.ts merge:**
   - Builder-4 added 2 new functions at end of file
   - No modifications to existing formatCurrency function
   - Low conflict risk - append-only change
   - Verify TypeScript exports work correctly

2. **Verify tRPC integration:**
   - Components import from trpc.currency.* procedures
   - All procedure calls type-safe (no TypeScript errors)
   - Confirm shadcn/ui components available (Select, AlertDialog, Dialog, Progress, etc.)

3. **Test component hierarchy:**
   - CurrencySelector → CurrencyConfirmationDialog → CurrencyConversionProgress → CurrencyConversionSuccess
   - State management flows correctly through dialog chain
   - Polling logic works (2-second interval for conversion status)

**Expected outcome:**
- /settings/currency page functional with CurrencySelector
- All 4 dialog components working
- utils.ts exports getCurrencySymbol() and getCurrencyName()
- Full conversion flow works: select → confirm → progress → success
- React Query cache invalidation triggers UI refresh

**Assigned to:** Integrator-1

**Estimated complexity:** LOW

## Independent Features (Direct Merge)

None - All builders have dependencies and require sequential integration.

---

## Parallel Execution Groups

### Group 1 (Sequential Execution - All zones dependent)
- **Integrator-1:** Zone 1 → Zone 2 → Zone 3 → Zone 4

**Rationale:** Clean dependency chain (Database → Service → Router → UI) requires sequential integration. Each zone depends on previous zone's successful completion.

---

## Integration Order

**Recommended sequence:**

1. **Zone 1: Database Foundation Layer**
   - Integrator-1 verifies Builder-1's database migration
   - Confirm Prisma Client regenerated
   - Validate schema changes applied
   - **Gate:** Migration status "up to date"

2. **Zone 2: Service Layer Integration**
   - Integrator-1 merges Builder-2's service layer
   - Verify imports of Prisma types work
   - Run unit tests (11/11 passing)
   - **Gate:** All service tests passing

3. **Zone 3: tRPC Router Integration**
   - Integrator-1 merges Builder-3's router
   - **Critical:** Merge root.ts (add currency router)
   - **Critical:** Merge constants.ts (add SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES)
   - Verify router integration with service layer
   - Run unit tests (21/21 passing)
   - **Gate:** TypeScript compiles, all router tests passing

4. **Zone 4: UI Components Integration**
   - Integrator-1 merges Builder-4's UI components
   - **Critical:** Merge utils.ts (add helper functions)
   - Verify tRPC integration in components
   - Test currency settings page loads
   - **Gate:** No TypeScript errors, components render

5. **Final Validation**
   - Run full test suite (all builders' tests)
   - Manual integration test (full conversion flow)
   - Performance test (conversion time <30s for 1,000 transactions)
   - Move to ivalidator for comprehensive validation

## Shared Resources Strategy

### Shared Types
**Issue:** Multiple builders use ConversionStatus enum and Prisma types

**Resolution:**
- Builder-1 defines in Prisma schema
- Builders 2, 3, 4 import from `@prisma/client`
- Type definitions in `src/types/currency.ts` created by Builder-3, used by Builder-4
- No conflicts - import-only usage

**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Zone 1 (verify exports), Zone 2-4 (verify imports)

### Shared Constants
**Issue:** SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES constant needed by Builder-3 (router) and Builder-4 (UI)

**Resolution:**
- Builder-3 creates SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES in `src/lib/constants.ts`
- Builder-4 imports and uses (no conflict)
- If constants.ts doesn't exist, Builder-3 creates it
- If exists, Builder-3 appends to end

**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Zone 3 (ensure constant exported correctly)

### Shared Utilities
**Issue:** Builder-4 extends utils.ts with getCurrencySymbol and getCurrencyName

**Resolution:**
- Builder-4 adds 2 new functions to end of utils.ts
- No modifications to existing formatCurrency
- Backward compatible - existing imports unaffected
- Export new functions alongside existing ones

**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Zone 4 (verify clean append, no conflicts)

### Shared Router Configuration
**Issue:** Builder-3 must register currency router in root.ts

**Resolution:**
- Add import: `import { currencyRouter } from './routers/currency.router'`
- Add to appRouter: `currency: currencyRouter,`
- Single 2-line addition, low conflict risk
- If other routers added in parallel (unlikely), merge carefully

**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Zone 3 (critical merge point)

### Modified Services
**Issue:** Builder-2 modifies plaid-sync.service.ts to handle currency conversion

**Resolution:**
- Builder-2 adds currency conversion logic for Plaid transactions
- Fetches exchange rate if account has originalCurrency
- Converts transaction amounts before saving
- Low risk modification - additive functionality

**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Zone 2 (verify Plaid sync not broken)

---

## Expected Challenges

### Challenge 1: Migration Already Applied Warning
**Impact:** Prisma migrate commands may show "Migration already applied" if Builder-1 ran migration locally
**Mitigation:** Use `npx prisma migrate status` to verify. If already applied, proceed to next zone. Migration is idempotent.
**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Zone 1

### Challenge 2: Environment Variable Not Set
**Impact:** Service layer tests fail if EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY not configured
**Mitigation:** Add EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY to `.env` before running tests. Use test key from exchangerate-api.com free tier.
**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Zone 2

### Challenge 3: Prisma Client Regeneration
**Impact:** Service and router imports fail if Prisma Client not regenerated after schema changes
**Mitigation:** Run `npx prisma generate` explicitly after Zone 1 completion to ensure types available
**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Zone 1

### Challenge 4: tRPC Type Safety Breaks
**Impact:** UI components show TypeScript errors if tRPC router not properly registered
**Mitigation:** Verify root.ts merge in Zone 3 before moving to Zone 4. Test tRPC type inference with simple query.
**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Zone 3

- [ ] No duplicate code remaining
- [ ] All imports resolve correctly (Prisma types, service functions, tRPC procedures)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles with no errors
- [ ] Consistent patterns across integrated code
- [ ] No conflicts in shared files (root.ts, constants.ts, utils.ts)

- [ ] Database migration applied and verified
- [ ] Environment variable EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY documented

---

## Notes for Integrators

**Important context:**
- This is iteration 9 (Currency Switching System) - HIGH RISK feature due to financial data integrity
- All 4 builders completed with COMPLETE status - no splits required
- Builder-2 spent most time (3 hours) on atomic transaction logic - critical to preserve
- Builder-3 confirmed full integration with Builder-2 (placeholder functions removed)
- Builder-4 verified all shadcn/ui dependencies available (no new packages needed)

**Watch out for:**
- Database migration rollback script exists - don't delete `ROLLBACK.md`
- Plaid sync modification in Builder-2 must not break existing sync functionality
- root.ts merge is critical - currency router must be registered for UI to work
- utils.ts modifications are append-only - don't modify existing formatCurrency signature
- EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY must be set before testing (get from exchangerate-api.com)

**Patterns to maintain:**
- Reference `patterns.md` for all conventions
- Atomic transaction pattern in convertUserCurrency() is critical - don't modify timeout
- Rate caching with 24-hour TTL must be preserved
- Conversion lock mechanism (IN_PROGRESS check) prevents concurrent operations
- All Decimal fields converted to string for JSON serialization in tRPC responses
- Progress polling uses 2-second interval (don't change - balance between UX and server load)

---

## Next Steps

1. Spawn Integrator-1 to execute Zones 1-4 sequentially
2. Integrator-1 creates integration report documenting:
   - Each zone merge results
   - Any conflicts encountered and resolution
   - Final test results (all 32 tests)
   - Environment setup verification
   - Manual testing checklist completion
3. Proceed to ivalidator for comprehensive validation:
   - Full conversion flow test
   - Performance test (1,000 transactions <30s)
   - Currency display verification across 20+ components
   - Error handling validation
   - Data integrity checks

---

## Critical Environment Setup

**Required before integration testing:**

1. **Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   # Should show: "Database schema is up to date"
   ```

2. **Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env
   EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

   # Get free API key from:
   # https://www.exchangerate-api.com/
   # Free tier: 1,500 requests/month
   ```

3. **Update .env.example:**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env.example for documentation
   EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY="get_from_exchangerate-api.com"
   ```

4. **Prisma Client Regeneration:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   # Confirms new types available for import
   ```
