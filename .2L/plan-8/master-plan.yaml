  Single-iteration focused CSS fix + landing page update.

  Two-pronged dark mode approach:
  1. Global fix: Update --muted-foreground CSS variable from 24 4% 66% to 24 6% 75%
  2. Safety net: Add explicit dark:text-warm-gray-300/400 overrides to critical components

  Landing page: Add AI Assistant as first feature in the grid to maximize visibility.

  All 3 master explorers agree this is SIMPLE complexity requiring 1 iteration.

key_findings:
  root_cause: "--muted-foreground dark mode value (24 4% 66%) provides ~3.5:1 contrast, below WCAG AA 4.5:1"

    scope: |
      1. Update --muted-foreground in globals.css dark mode section
      2. Add dark:text-warm-gray-300/400 overrides to dashboard components:
         - NetWorthCard.tsx (3 instances)
         - TopCategoriesCard.tsx (4 instances)
         - FinancialHealthIndicator.tsx (2 instances)
         - RecentTransactionsCard.tsx (1 instance)
         - BudgetAlertsCard.tsx (1 instance)
      3. Review chat components (may already be fixed)
      4. Add AI Assistant feature section to landing page (first position)
      5. Verify WCAG AA compliance
