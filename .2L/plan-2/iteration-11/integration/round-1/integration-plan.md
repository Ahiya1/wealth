# Integration Plan - Iteration 11 Round 1

**Created:** 2025-10-03T00:00:00Z
**Iteration:** plan-2/iteration-11 (Production-Ready Foundation)
**Total builders to integrate:** 4

---

## Executive Summary

Iteration 11 successfully enhanced the production-ready foundation with dark mode support and loading states across 60+ components. All 4 builders completed their work with ZERO file conflicts detected. The integration is LOW RISK with high parallelization potential due to clean separation of concerns.

**Key Insights:**
- Builder 1 created the foundation (Card component) that cascaded to 80+ components automatically
- Builder 2 and Builder 3 built upon Builder 1's foundation with no conflicts (different files)
- Builder 4 worked in complete isolation (added `loading` prop to Button component)
- Only 1 file overlap: `affirmation-card.tsx` (Builder 1 fixed, Builder 2 verified) - COMPATIBLE changes
- TypeScript compilation: 0 errors across all builders

## Integration Zones

### Zone 1: UI Primitives Foundation (Builder 1)

**Builders involved:** Builder-1 only

**Conflict type:** None (foundation layer)

**Risk level:** LOW

**Description:**
Builder 1 fixed broken UI primitives and enhanced the base Card component. This is the foundation that other builders depend on. The Card component change with `dark:shadow-none dark:border-warm-gray-700` automatically cascades to 80+ components throughout the app.

**Files affected:**
- `/src/components/ui/affirmation-card.tsx` - Dark mode gradient + shadow-border pattern
- `/src/components/ui/stat-card.tsx` - Dark mode gradient + multiple text colors
- `/src/components/ui/empty-state.tsx` - Dark mode text/icon colors
- `/src/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx` - Dark mode navigation text
- `/src/components/ui/progress-ring.tsx` - SVG strokes with className-based dark mode
- `/src/components/ui/card.tsx` - CRITICAL: Shadow-border pattern added (cascades to 80+ components)
- `/src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx` - Semantic token overlay, shadow-border pattern

**Integration strategy:**
1. Direct merge of all 7 files (no conflicts)
2. Verify Card component cascade effect by checking a few derived components
3. Test AffirmationCard gradient in both themes (complex gradient)
4. Test ProgressRing SVG with className-based strokes
5. Verify semantic token primitives still work (Button, Input, Dialog, etc.)

**Expected outcome:**
- All 5 broken primitives have dark mode support
- Card component provides automatic dark mode borders to all derived components
- 60-70% of app has basic dark mode support through Card inheritance

**Assigned to:** Integrator-1

**Estimated complexity:** LOW (clean, well-tested foundation)

---

### Zone 2: Dashboard & Auth Components (Builder 2)

**Builders involved:** Builder-2 only

**Conflict type:** None (unique files, depends on Zone 1)

**Risk level:** MEDIUM

**Description:**
Builder 2 enhanced 11 high-visibility components (Dashboard + Auth pages) with dark mode support. The most complex component is DashboardSidebar with 30+ color classes modified. FinancialHealthIndicator has complex SVG gauge with Framer Motion animations. Auth forms have consistent terracotta error styling.

**Files affected:**
- `/src/components/dashboard/DashboardSidebar.tsx` - 30+ color classes (navigation, demo badge, user dropdown)
- `/src/components/ui/affirmation-card.tsx` - Verified Builder 1's fix (no changes needed)
- `/src/components/dashboard/FinancialHealthIndicator.tsx` - SVG gauge + gradient + motion
- `/src/components/dashboard/DashboardStats.tsx` - Fixed hardcoded sage button
- `/src/components/dashboard/RecentTransactionsCard.tsx` - Transaction list text colors
- `/src/components/dashboard/BudgetSummaryCard.tsx` - No changes (uses semantic tokens)
- `/src/components/dashboard/NetWorthCard.tsx` - No changes (uses semantic tokens)
- `/src/components/dashboard/IncomeVsExpensesCard.tsx` - No changes (uses semantic tokens)
- `/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Greeting text dark mode
- `/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Dashboard background dark mode
- `/src/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx` - Terracotta error pattern
- `/src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx` - Terracotta error pattern
- `/src/components/auth/ResetPasswordForm.tsx` - Terracotta error pattern

**Integration strategy:**
1. Merge all 11 files (no conflicts with other builders)
2. Verify AffirmationCard is compatible (Builder 1 fixed, Builder 2 verified)
3. Test DashboardSidebar thoroughly (most complex component)
4. Test FinancialHealthIndicator SVG animations with dark mode
5. Test auth forms for terracotta error messages
6. Verify dashboard layout background adapts to theme

**Expected outcome:**
- Dashboard and Auth pages fully functional in dark mode
- Consistent terracotta error styling across all auth forms
- SVG gauge works with Framer Motion in both themes
- Navigation states clear in both themes

**Assigned to:** Integrator-1

**Estimated complexity:** MEDIUM (complex components, but well-tested)

---

### Zone 3: Accounts & Transactions (Builder 3)

**Builders involved:** Builder-3 only

**Conflict type:** None (unique files, depends on Zone 1)

**Risk level:** LOW

**Description:**
Builder 3 applied shadow-soft pattern and dark mode variants to all 19 Account and Transaction components. Most components inherited basic dark mode support from Builder 1's Card enhancement, so Builder 3 focused on:
- Adding explicit shadow-soft-md/shadow-soft to cards requiring elevation
- Enhancing hover states with dark mode variants
- Fixing typography colors for dark mode readability
- Replacing old `hover:shadow-md` with new shadow-soft pattern

**Files affected:**
- `/src/components/accounts/AccountCard.tsx` - Shadow-soft-md with dark border
- `/src/components/accounts/AccountListClient.tsx` - Typography dark mode
- `/src/components/accounts/AccountDetailClient.tsx` - 5 cards with elevated shadows
- `/src/components/accounts/AccountForm.tsx` - Verified (Builder 4 added loading, Builder 3 checked)
- `/src/components/transactions/TransactionCard.tsx` - Shadow-soft + enhanced hover
- `/src/components/transactions/TransactionListPage.tsx` - Typography dark mode
- `/src/components/transactions/TransactionDetail.tsx` - 7 cards (header + 6 detail sections)
- `/src/components/transactions/TransactionDetailClient.tsx` - Elevated card shadow
- `/src/components/transactions/BulkActionsBar.tsx` - Maximum elevation (shadow-soft-lg)
- `/src/components/transactions/CategorizationStats.tsx` - Standard card shadow
- (Additional 9 files verified as using primitives, no changes needed)

**Integration strategy:**
1. Direct merge of all 19 files (no conflicts)
2. Verify shadow-soft pattern applied consistently
3. Test AccountCard and TransactionCard in both themes
4. Test detail pages for proper card elevation
5. Test BulkActionsBar floating action bar
6. Verify hover states work in dark mode

**Expected outcome:**
- All Account and Transaction components have soft shadows in light mode
- Dark mode borders replace shadows for clear card separation
- Typography readable with proper contrast in both themes
- Hover states work seamlessly in both themes

**Assigned to:** Integrator-1

**Estimated complexity:** LOW (straightforward pattern application)

---

### Zone 4: Button Loading States (Builder 4)

**Builders involved:** Builder-4 only

**Conflict type:** None (completely independent)

**Risk level:** LOW

**Description:**
Builder 4 enhanced the Button and AlertDialogAction components with a `loading?: boolean` prop, then applied loading states to 24 buttons across the app. Fixed 6 CRITICAL bugs where delete/archive buttons had NO loading state at all. This work is completely orthogonal to dark mode work.

**Files affected:**
- `/src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Added `loading?: boolean` prop with Loader2 spinner
- `/src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx` - Added `loading?: boolean` prop to AlertDialogAction
- Form submissions (10 files): TransactionForm, AddTransactionForm, AccountForm, BudgetForm, GoalForm, CategoryForm, ProfileSection, SignInForm, SignUpForm, ResetPasswordForm
- Delete/Archive actions (5 files): TransactionList, GoalList, BudgetList, AccountList, CategoryList

**Integration strategy:**
1. Direct merge of all 17 files
2. Verify Button component loading prop works (auto-disable, spinner, text change)
3. Verify AlertDialogAction loading prop works
4. Test a few form submissions for spinner feedback
5. Test a few delete actions for spinner feedback
6. Verify no double-click issues

**Expected outcome:**
- All form submission buttons show Loader2 spinner during save
- All delete/archive buttons show spinner during operation
- Buttons auto-disable when loading to prevent double-clicks
- Fixed 6 critical bugs where buttons had NO loading state

**Assigned to:** Integrator-1

**Estimated complexity:** LOW (independent, well-tested)

## File Overlap Analysis

### Files Modified by Multiple Builders

| File | Builder 1 | Builder 2 | Builder 3 | Builder 4 | Conflict Risk |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| `/src/components/ui/affirmation-card.tsx` | Modified (dark mode) | Verified (no changes) | - | - | NONE - Compatible |
| `/src/components/accounts/AccountForm.tsx` | - | - | Verified (shadows inherited) | Modified (loading prop) | NONE - Different concerns |
| `/src/components/transactions/TransactionForm.tsx` | - | - | Verified (shadows inherited) | Modified (loading prop) | NONE - Different concerns |
| `/src/components/transactions/AddTransactionForm.tsx` | - | - | Verified (shadows inherited) | Modified (loading prop) | NONE - Different concerns |

**Conflict Assessment:**

**AffirmationCard Overlap:**
- Builder 1: Added dark mode gradient, shadow-border pattern, icon/text colors
- Builder 2: Verified the fix works correctly, made NO changes
- **Verdict:** NO CONFLICT - Builder 2 simply confirmed Builder 1's work

**Form File Overlaps:**
- Builder 3: Verified forms inherit shadow-soft from Input primitives (Builder 1's work), made NO changes
- Builder 4: Added `loading={isLoading}` prop to submit buttons
- **Verdict:** NO CONFLICT - Different aspects (Builder 3 verified containers, Builder 4 modified button props)

**Overall Risk:** ZERO conflicts detected. All changes are either in different files or different aspects of the same file.

---

## Integration Strategy

### Sequential vs Parallel

**Recommendation:** SEQUENTIAL (with partial parallelization)

**Rationale:**
- Builder 1 is the foundation layer (Card component, primitives)
- Builders 2 and 3 depend on Builder 1's Card enhancement
- Builder 4 is independent but shares some files with Builder 3 (forms)

**Why not fully parallel?**
- Builder 2 and 3 both reference "verified Builder 1's work" in their reports
- Testing will be cleaner if Builder 1's foundation is integrated first
- Risk is already LOW, so parallelization offers minimal time savings

---

## Integration Order

**Recommended sequence:**

### Step 1: Foundation Layer (Builder 1)
**Priority:** HIGHEST
**Integrator:** Integrator-1
**Zone:** Zone 1 (UI Primitives Foundation)

**Actions:**
1. Merge all 7 files from Builder 1
2. Run TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit` (expect 0 errors)
3. Run build: `npm run build` (expect success)
4. Test in browser:
   - Toggle theme switch 10 times (no flashes)
   - Verify Card component has borders in dark mode
   - Test AffirmationCard gradient in both themes
   - Test ProgressRing SVG strokes adapt to theme
   - Verify semantic token primitives still work

**Success criteria:**

## Shared Resources Strategy

### Shared Components Enhanced

**Card Component (Builder 1):**
- **Issue:** Base Card component is used by 80+ components
- **Resolution:** Builder 1 added `dark:shadow-none dark:border-warm-gray-700` to Card
- **Impact:** All components using Card automatically get dark mode borders
- **Builders affected:** Builder 2 and Builder 3 both benefit from this cascade
- **Responsible:** Already handled by Builder 1

**Button Component (Builder 4):**
- **Issue:** Button component is used by 100+ buttons across app
- **Resolution:** Builder 4 added `loading?: boolean` prop
- **Impact:** All buttons can now use loading states (opt-in via prop)
- **Builders affected:** All builders can now use loading prop in their components
- **Responsible:** Already handled by Builder 4

**AlertDialogAction Component (Builder 4):**
- **Issue:** Used for delete/archive confirmations
- **Resolution:** Builder 4 added `loading?: boolean` prop (same pattern as Button)
- **Impact:** All delete/archive actions can show loading feedback
- **Responsible:** Already handled by Builder 4

### Shared Patterns

**Shadow-Border Pattern:**
- **Established by:** Builder 1 (Card component)
- **Applied by:** Builder 2 (Dashboard), Builder 3 (Accounts/Transactions)
- **Pattern:**
  ```tsx
  // Standard cards
  shadow-soft dark:shadow-none dark:border dark:border-warm-gray-700

  // Elevated cards
  shadow-soft-md dark:shadow-none dark:border dark:border-warm-gray-600

  // Maximum elevation
  shadow-soft-lg dark:shadow-none dark:border-warm-gray-600
  ```
- **Verification:** Check 5-10 random Card usages to ensure pattern is consistent

**Dark Mode Text Colors:**
- **Pattern:**
  ```tsx
  text-sage-600 dark:text-sage-400
  text-warm-gray-700 dark:text-warm-gray-300
  text-warm-gray-900 dark:text-warm-gray-100
  text-gold-700 dark:text-gold-400
  ```
- **Applied by:** All builders consistently
- **Verification:** Visual inspection in both themes (check contrast)

**SVG Dark Mode:**
- **Pattern:**
  ```tsx
  // Use className, not inline stroke attribute
  <circle className="stroke-warm-gray-200 dark:stroke-warm-gray-700" />
  <motion.circle className="stroke-sage-500 dark:stroke-sage-400" />
  ```
- **Applied by:** Builder 1 (ProgressRing), Builder 2 (FinancialHealthIndicator)
- **Verification:** Test SVG components in both themes, verify animations work

**Terracotta Error Pattern:**
- **Pattern:**
  ```tsx
  text-terracotta-700 bg-terracotta-50 border border-terracotta-200
  rounded-lg shadow-soft p-3
  dark:text-terracotta-400 dark:bg-terracotta-950 dark:border-terracotta-800
  ```
- **Applied by:** Builder 2 (all 3 auth forms)
- **Verification:** Trigger error in auth form, verify warm terracotta color (not harsh red)

---

## Expected Challenges

### Challenge 1: Card Component Cascade Verification
**Impact:** If Card cascade doesn't work correctly, 80+ components won't have dark mode borders
**Mitigation:**
1. Test Card component directly first
2. Spot-check 5-10 derived components (AccountCard, TransactionCard, GoalCard, etc.)
3. If issues found, investigate Card className structure
**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Step 1

### Challenge 2: Builder 1 Build Error (Page Data Collection)
**Impact:** Builder 1 reported build error during page data collection (Cannot find module './1682.js')
**Mitigation:**
1. This is a pre-existing Next.js webpack issue (noted in Builder 1 report)
2. TypeScript compilation succeeded (0 errors)
3. If build fails during integration, run: `rm -rf .next && npm install`
4. Re-run build
**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Step 1

### Challenge 3: SVG Animations with Dark Mode
**Impact:** ProgressRing and FinancialHealthIndicator use Framer Motion with SVG strokes
**Mitigation:**
1. Builders already tested this (both use className-based strokes)
2. Test ProgressRing with theme toggle
3. Test FinancialHealthIndicator gauge with theme toggle
4. Verify animations smooth in both themes
**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Step 2

### Challenge 4: Form File Overlap (Builder 3 and Builder 4)
**Impact:** 3 forms touched by both builders (AccountForm, TransactionForm, AddTransactionForm)
**Mitigation:**
1. Builder 3 made NO changes (just verified shadow inheritance)
2. Builder 4 added loading prop to submit buttons
3. No actual code conflict - just verification overlap
4. Merge both changes (Builder 4's loading prop is the only actual change)
**Responsible:** Integrator-1 in Step 2

---

## Notes for Integrators

### Important Context

**Builder 1 Foundation:**
- Builder 1's Card component enhancement is CRITICAL - it cascades to 80+ components
- If Card borders don't appear in dark mode, all downstream components fail
- Test Card component thoroughly in Step 1 before proceeding

**Builder 2 Complexity:**
- DashboardSidebar has 30+ color classes - most complex component in iteration
- FinancialHealthIndicator has SVG + Framer Motion - test animations carefully
- Auth forms have new terracotta error pattern - verify consistency across all 3 forms

**Builder 3 Shadow Pattern:**
- Builder 3 applied shadow-soft pattern consistently across 19 files
- Some components inherit from Card (no explicit changes)
- Some components need explicit shadow-soft-md for elevation
- Check a few components to verify pattern is correct

**Builder 4 Independence:**
- Builder 4's work is completely orthogonal to dark mode
- Loading states work in both light and dark themes automatically
- If loading states have issues, it won't affect dark mode integration
- Can debug loading states separately if needed

### Watch Out For

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Build Error:** Builder 1 reported Next.js page data collection error - may need `rm -rf .next && npm install`
2. **SVG Strokes:** Ensure className-based strokes work with Framer Motion (builders tested this)
3. **Card Cascade:** If Card borders missing in dark mode, check className merge in Card component
4. **Form Overlaps:** Builder 3 verified forms, Builder 4 modified buttons - both changes should coexist peacefully

**Not Issues:**
- AffirmationCard "overlap" - Builder 2 just verified Builder 1's work (no conflict)
- Form file "overlaps" - Different aspects (shadows vs loading props)
- TypeScript errors - All builders report 0 errors

### Patterns to Maintain

**Dark Mode Pattern (from patterns.md):**
1. Semantic tokens for backgrounds: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`
2. Custom colors with dark variants: `text-sage-600 dark:text-sage-400`
3. Gradients with dark alternatives: `from-sage-50 dark:from-warm-gray-900`
4. SVG strokes with className: `className="stroke-sage-500 dark:stroke-sage-400"`

**Shadow-Border Pattern (from patterns.md):**
```tsx
// Standard cards
shadow-soft dark:shadow-none dark:border dark:border-warm-gray-700

// Elevated cards
shadow-soft-md dark:shadow-none dark:border dark:border-warm-gray-600

// Maximum elevation
shadow-soft-lg dark:shadow-none
```

**Loading State Pattern (from patterns.md):**
```tsx
<Button loading={isLoading}>
  {isLoading ? 'Saving...' : 'Save'}
</Button>
```

**Verify Consistency:**
- All shadows follow shadow-soft pattern (not shadow-lg, shadow-md)
- All borders use warm-gray palette (not generic gray)
- All text colors have dark variants
- All loading buttons show spinner + text change

---

## Parallel Execution Groups

### Group 1: Foundation (Sequential)
**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes

- **Integrator-1:** Zone 1 (Builder 1 - UI Primitives)
  - Merge 7 files
  - Test Card component thoroughly
  - Verify cascade effect
  - Run TypeScript + build
  - MUST COMPLETE before Group 2

### Group 2: Application Layer (Can run in parallel after Group 1)
**Estimated time:** 45-60 minutes

- **Integrator-1:** Zones 2, 3, 4 (Builders 2, 3, 4 - All together)
  - Merge 47 files (11 + 19 + 17)
  - Test Dashboard components
  - Test Accounts/Transactions components
  - Test Loading states
  - Run TypeScript + build
  - Cross-check all zones work together

**Total estimated integration time:** 75-105 minutes

---

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Integration Risk:** LOW

### Risk Factors

**1. Card Component Cascade Effect**
- **Risk:** Card enhancement might not cascade correctly to derived components
- **Probability:** LOW (Builder 1 tested this)
- **Impact:** HIGH (would affect 80+ components)
- **Mitigation:** Test Card component first, spot-check derived components

**2. SVG Animations with Dark Mode**
- **Risk:** className-based SVG strokes might break Framer Motion animations
- **Probability:** VERY LOW (builders tested this extensively)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (would affect ProgressRing and FinancialHealthIndicator)
- **Mitigation:** Test SVG components in both themes, verify animations smooth

**3. Build Process Issues**
- **Risk:** Next.js build might fail with page data collection error
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (Builder 1 reported this issue)
- **Impact:** LOW (TypeScript compilation succeeded, issue is environmental)
- **Mitigation:** Run `rm -rf .next && npm install` if build fails

**4. Form File Coordination**
- **Risk:** Builder 3 and Builder 4 changes might conflict in form files
- **Probability:** VERY LOW (different aspects - shadows vs loading props)
- **Impact:** LOW (easy to resolve if conflict occurs)
- **Mitigation:** Builder 3 made no changes, Builder 4 added loading prop - no actual conflict

### Mitigation Strategies

**Strategy 1: Sequential Foundation Integration**
- Integrate Builder 1 first before other builders
- Ensures Card cascade effect is stable
- Reduces risk of cascading failures

**Strategy 2: Incremental Testing**
- Test after each integration step (Foundation → Application Layer)
- Catch issues early before they compound
- Easier to debug when problems isolated

**Strategy 3: Visual QA Checklist**
- Use detailed testing checklist for each builder's work
- Verify dark mode, shadows, loading states systematically
- Don't skip steps even if everything "looks fine"

**Strategy 4: Rollback Plan**
- All changes are in className strings (easy to revert)
- No structural changes to components
- Can rollback per-file or per-builder if issues found
- Git history makes rollback straightforward

## Recommendations for Integrator

### Pre-Integration Checklist

**Before starting:**
1. [ ] Ensure working directory is clean (no uncommitted changes)
2. [ ] Create integration branch: `git checkout -b integration/iteration-11-round-1`
3. [ ] Read all 4 builder reports thoroughly
4. [ ] Understand the cascade effect (Card component)
5. [ ] Have testing checklist ready

**Setup:**
1. [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. [ ] Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
3. [ ] Run dev server: `npm run dev`
4. [ ] Open browser to http://localhost:3000
5. [ ] Open browser DevTools console

### Integration Process

**Step 1: Merge Builder 1 (Foundation)**
1. Copy all 7 files from Builder 1's working directory
2. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` - expect 0 errors
3. Run `npm run build` - expect success (ignore page data collection if it fails)
4. Test Card component in both themes
5. Verify 5 broken primitives work in dark mode
6. Commit: `git commit -m "Integrate Builder 1: UI Primitives & Dark Mode Foundation"`

**Step 2: Merge Builders 2, 3, 4 (Application Layer)**
1. Copy all files from Builder 2 (11 files)
2. Copy all files from Builder 3 (19 files)
3. Copy all files from Builder 4 (17 files)
4. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` - expect 0 errors
5. Run `npm run build` - expect success
6. Test Dashboard, Accounts, Transactions, Loading states
7. Commit: `git commit -m "Integrate Builders 2-4: Dashboard, Accounts/Transactions, Loading States"`

**Step 3: Final Testing**
1. Full app walkthrough in light mode
2. Full app walkthrough in dark mode
3. Toggle theme on every page
4. Test user flows end-to-end
5. Check console for errors
6. Verify build output
7. Commit: `git commit -m "Integration Round 1 Complete - Iteration 11"`

### Testing Priorities

**Critical (Must Test):**
1. Card component shadow-border pattern
2. Theme toggle (no flashes)
3. Dashboard in both themes
4. Form submission with loading spinner

**High (Should Test):**
1. Accounts/Transactions in both themes
2. Auth forms with terracotta errors
3. SVG components (ProgressRing, FinancialHealthIndicator)
4. Delete/Archive actions with loading

**Medium (Nice to Test):**
1. All primitives in both themes
2. BulkActionsBar floating action bar
3. Breadcrumb navigation
4. Empty states

### Post-Integration Validation

**Required:**
1. [ ] TypeScript: 0 errors
2. [ ] Build: Success
3. [ ] No console errors
4. [ ] Theme toggle works on 5+ pages
5. [ ] At least 1 form submission tested
6. [ ] At least 1 delete action tested

**Recommended:**
1. [ ] Test on 10+ pages
2. [ ] Test all form types
3. [ ] Test all delete/archive actions
4. [ ] Cross-browser testing (if available)

### If Issues Found

**TypeScript Errors:**
1. Read error message carefully
2. Check which builder introduced the error
3. Review builder's report for known issues
4. Fix locally or contact builder

**Build Errors:**
1. If page data collection fails: `rm -rf .next && npm install && npm run build`
2. If TypeScript compilation fails: Check builder reports for compatibility
3. If runtime errors: Check browser console, review component changes

**Visual Issues:**
1. Card borders missing: Check Card component className structure
2. SVG animations broken: Check className-based strokes vs inline strokes
3. Text unreadable: Check dark mode color variants
4. Loading states not working: Check Button component loading prop

**Rollback Strategy:**
1. Rollback specific file: `git checkout HEAD -- path/to/file`
2. Rollback specific builder: Revert commit for that builder
3. Rollback entire integration: `git reset --hard HEAD~3` (adjust number)

## Questions for Validator (After Integration)

After integration is complete, the validator should verify:

1. **Did all 54 files merge cleanly with no conflicts?**
2. **Does TypeScript compile with 0 errors?**
3. **Does the build succeed?**
4. **Do all UI primitives work in both themes?**
5. **Does the Card component cascade effect work (borders in dark mode)?**
6. **Do all Dashboard components work in both themes?**
7. **Do all Accounts/Transactions components have proper shadows/borders?**
8. **Do all 24 buttons show loading spinners during actions?**
9. **Is theme switching instant with no flashes?**
10. **Are there any console errors or warnings?**

## Next Steps

After successful integration of Round 1:

1. **Integrator completes work**
   - All zones integrated
   - All tests passing
   - Creates integrator report

2. **Proceed to IValidator**
   - IValidator reviews integration quality
   - Runs comprehensive validation suite
   - Approves or requests fixes

3. **If approved:**
   - Merge to main branch
   - Deploy to staging
   - Prepare for Iteration 12

4. **If issues found:**
   - IValidator creates issue list
   - Determine if new builders needed (Round 2)
   - Or if integrator can fix directly
