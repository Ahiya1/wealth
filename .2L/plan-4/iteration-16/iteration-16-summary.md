# Iteration 16: Polish, Testing & Production Readiness

## Context
This is the final iteration of plan-4 (Mobile Experience Polish). Iterations 14 and 15 have completed:
- ✅ Foundation & Navigation (bottom nav, safe areas, touch targets)
- ✅ Component Optimization & Performance (dynamic imports, memoization, charts, forms)

## Iteration 16 Scope (from master plan)
- Virtual scrolling for transaction lists
- Route prefetching for bottom nav
- Performance-aware animations
- Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Cross-device testing
- Final polish

## Assessment
Given the excellent work in iterations 14-15, most critical work is complete. Iteration 16 will focus on:
1. Final validation and testing
2. Documentation of mobile patterns
3. Production readiness verification
4. Any remaining polish items

## Approach
Execute lightweight validation iteration with focus on testing rather than new features.
