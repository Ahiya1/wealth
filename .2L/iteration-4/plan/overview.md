# 2L Iteration Plan - Wealth Conscious Money App (Iteration 4)

## Project Vision

Transform the Wealth app from a functional but generic financial tracker into a **beautiful, calming "conscious money" experience** where users feel empowered, not anxious about their finances. This iteration focuses on UI/UX polish, design system implementation, and creating a mindful relationship with money through thoughtful colors, animations, and encouraging micro-copy.

**Philosophy:** "Wealth consciousness, where money flows from stillness and value creation, rather than manipulation."

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working (85% Backend Complete)
- **Backend Infrastructure:** 100% complete - all 7 tRPC routers fully implemented with comprehensive CRUD operations
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase, all Prisma models established, migrations applied
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth fully integrated with auto-sync to Prisma
- **Components:** 85% built - forms exist, charts work, but styling is generic
- **Integration:** Solid foundation - tRPC + React Query working smoothly

### What Needs Work (UI/UX at 40%)
- **Colors:** Anxiety-inducing bright green/harsh red palette (needs sage green + warm gray)
- **Typography:** System fonts only (needs Inter + Crimson Pro serif headlines)
- **Animations:** Zero smooth transitions (needs framer-motion)
- **Toast Notifications:** Basic custom implementation (needs sonner for better UX)
- **Empty States:** Missing actionable empty screens
- **Micro-copy:** Generic messaging (needs encouraging, educational tone)
- **Loading States:** Inconsistent skeleton screens
- **Mobile Experience:** Works but not optimized

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

**Risk 1: Builder-0 Foundation Bottleneck**
- **Impact:** HIGH - All other builders blocked if design system incomplete
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - CSS variable HSL format can be tricky
- **Mitigation:**
  - Allocate experienced builder to Builder-0
  - Test opacity modifiers work (bg-sage-500/50)
  - Verify font loading doesn't block render
  - Have integration specialist review before proceeding

**Risk 2: Component API Inconsistency**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Inconsistent component APIs hurt developer experience and integration
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - 3 sub-builders creating 10 components in parallel
- **Mitigation:**
  - Define prop patterns upfront in patterns.md
  - Use TypeScript discriminated unions
  - Consistent naming (variant, not type/kind)
  - Code review before integration

**Risk 3: Color Application Inconsistency**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Breaks "calm" aesthetic if some pages still use red-600/green-600
- **Likelihood:** HIGH - Multiple builders applying colors across 8+ pages
- **Mitigation:**
  - Create color usage rules document
  - Search codebase for red-600/green-600 before completion
  - Validation checklist includes color audit
  - Provide exact ColorIntent mapping

### Medium Risks

**Risk 4: Animation Performance on Mobile**
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Janky animations create bad UX
- **Likelihood:** LOW - framer-motion is well-optimized
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test on mobile devices (not just desktop)
  - Use transform/opacity only (GPU accelerated)
  - Respect prefers-reduced-motion
  - Keep durations short (200-300ms)

**Risk 5: Builder Scope Creep**
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Builders take too long, integration delayed
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Easy to over-engineer components
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strict time-boxing (90 min max per builder)
  - Clear acceptance criteria before starting
  - Defer non-critical features to Iteration 5
  - Integration specialist can cut scope if needed

**Risk 6: Font Loading Flash (FOUT)**
- **Impact:** LOW - Brief flash of unstyled text on first load
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Google Fonts can be slow
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use next/font with display: 'swap'
  - Fallback fonts with similar metrics
  - Font preloading
  - Accept minor FOUT for MVP (optimize later)

### Low Risks

**Risk 7: sonner Bundle Size**
- **Impact:** LOW - 5KB gzipped is minimal
- **Likelihood:** CERTAIN - Will increase bundle size
- **Mitigation:** Accept trade-off (better UX worth 5KB)

**Risk 8: Existing Tests Breaking**
- **Impact:** LOW - Tests are isolated from UI changes
- **Likelihood:** LOW - Only changing presentation layer
- **Mitigation:** Run test suite before/after, fix if needed

## Integration Strategy

### File Organization
All builders work in isolated areas to minimize conflicts:

**Builder-0 (Foundation):**
- `src/app/globals.css` (CSS variables)
- `tailwind.config.ts` (colors, fonts)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (font loading)
- `package.json` (dependencies)
- `src/lib/animations.ts` (animation utilities)

**Builder-1 (Components):**
- `src/components/ui/stat-card.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/ui/affirmation-card.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/ui/empty-state.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/ui/encouraging-progress.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/ui/progress-ring.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/ui/page-transition.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/accounts/AccountCard.tsx` (enhance)
- `src/components/transactions/TransactionCard.tsx` (enhance)
- `src/components/categories/CategoryBadge.tsx` (enhance)
- `src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx` (enhance)

**Builder-2 (Dashboard + Landing):**
- `src/app/page.tsx` (landing page)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` (dashboard)
- `src/components/dashboard/*` (all dashboard cards)

**Builder-3 (Accounts + Transactions):**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/accounts/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/transactions/page.tsx`
- `src/components/accounts/AccountList.tsx`
- `src/components/transactions/TransactionListPage.tsx`

**Builder-4 (Budgets):**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/budgets/page.tsx`
- `src/components/budgets/BudgetList.tsx`
- `src/components/budgets/BudgetCard.tsx`
- `src/components/budgets/BudgetProgressBar.tsx` (replace with EncouragingProgress)

**Builder-5 (Analytics + Goals):**
- `src/app/(dashboard)/analytics/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/goals/page.tsx`
- `src/components/analytics/*Chart.tsx` (color updates only)
- `src/components/goals/GoalCard.tsx`

**Builder-6 (Testing):**
- Manual testing across all pages
- No file changes (bug reports only)

### Merge Strategy
1. **Builder-0 completes** → All files committed → Other builders can start
2. **Builder-1 (3 sub-builders) complete** → Components committed → Page builders can use them
3. **Builders 2-5 work in parallel** → Minimal file overlap
4. **Integration specialist merges** → Resolves any conflicts → Validates build
5. **Builder-6 validates** → Creates bug list → Builders fix critical issues

### Potential Conflicts
**Low Conflict Risk:**
- Each builder has distinct file ownership
- Shared components created before page builders start
- No database schema changes
- No tRPC router changes

**If Conflicts Occur:**
- Prioritize Builder-0 and Builder-1 outputs (foundation)
- Page builders re-pull latest before final commit
- Integration specialist manually resolves CSS/import conflicts

## Deployment Plan

**Iteration 4 is Development Only** (no production deployment)

### Local Development Process
1. Builders develop on feature branches
2. Test locally with `npm run dev`
3. Integration specialist merges to main branch
4. Validation on clean local environment
5. Production build test: `npm run build` must succeed

### Pre-Production Checklist (for future iterations)
- [ ] All environment variables documented
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Supabase Auth configuration verified
- [ ] API keys secured (Anthropic, Plaid)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed (WCAG AA)

### Post-Iteration 4 Next Steps
- **Iteration 5:** Advanced features (recurring transactions, budget rollover, goal milestones)
- **Iteration 6:** Mobile optimization (bottom nav, touch gestures)
- **Iteration 7:** Performance optimization (code splitting, lazy loading)
- **Iteration 8:** Production deployment (Vercel + Supabase)

## Philosophy Reminders for Builders

Every decision should ask: **"Does this make the user feel calm and empowered?"**

### Color Psychology
- Sage greens → growth, stability, nature (NOT bright/alarming)
- Warm grays → sophistication, calm (NOT harsh black/white contrast)
- Avoid traffic light metaphors (red = bad, green = good)
- Use coral for attention (soft, not panic)
- Use gold for achievement (celebration)

### Typography Intentions
- Serif headlines → trustworthy, established, human
- Sans-serif body → modern, readable, clean
- Generous spacing → breathing room, not overwhelm
- Tabular figures → aligned numbers reduce cognitive load

### Animation as Care
- Slow, smooth (300-500ms) vs snappy (150ms)
- Purposeful (guide attention) vs gratuitous (distract)
- Ease-out (decelerates naturally)
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion

### Micro-copy as Encouragement
- "You're doing well!" vs "Budget exceeded"
- "You spent $42 less this month" vs "Spending decreased"
- Specific, educational, celebratory
- Never judgmental or condescending
