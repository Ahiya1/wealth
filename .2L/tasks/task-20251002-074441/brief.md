## Type
NEW_CODE (Content update)

## Timestamp
20251002-074441

## Context
- Related iteration: iteration-6 (Onboarding Experience & User Separation)
- Patterns to follow: iteration-6/plan/patterns.md
- MCP tools available: playwright, chrome-devtools, screenshot

## Scope
- Estimated files: 3-4 files (landing page, onboarding steps)
- Estimated time: 30-45 minutes
- Complexity: SIMPLE

## Problem Statement
Current landing page and onboarding wizard contain generic "conscious money" philosophy copy that doesn't accurately reflect the actual features built in the dashboard:
- Real features: Accounts, Transactions, Budgets, Goals, Analytics
- Landing shows: Generic aspirational content
- Onboarding steps: Don't reference actual sections of the app

## Agent Assignment
Single builder agent

## Success Criteria
- Landing page hero/features match actual dashboard capabilities
- Onboarding steps reference real sections (Accounts, Transactions, Budgets, Goals)
- Copy is accurate and helpful (not generic)
- Screenshots/mockups show real UI (optional, if time permits)
