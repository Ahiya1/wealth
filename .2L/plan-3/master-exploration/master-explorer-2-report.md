## Focus Area
Dependencies & Risk Assessment

## Vision Summary
Transform the locally-developed USD-based wealth tracking app into a production-ready, NIS-native personal finance dashboard deployed on Vercel with production Supabase infrastructure.

---

## Requirements Analysis

### Scope Assessment
- **Total features identified:** 7 must-have features
- **User stories/acceptance criteria:** 62 acceptance criteria across all features
- **Estimated total work:** 8-12 hours

### Complexity Rating
**Overall Complexity: COMPLEX**

**Rationale:**
- Multiple external service dependencies (Vercel, Supabase, GitHub) requiring coordination
- Currency migration touches 55+ files across the codebase (formatCurrency references)
- Production infrastructure setup with security-critical configuration (email verification, admin user creation)
- Zero-downtime requirement for fresh deployment with data persistence
- 4 distinct phases: Currency Migration → Infrastructure Setup → Deployment → Verification

## Environment Variable Dependencies

### Required Variables (7 total)

**1. DATABASE_URL** (HIGH SECURITY)
- **Purpose:** PostgreSQL connection string for Prisma migrations
- **Format:** `postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?pgbouncer=true`
- **Risk:** CRITICAL - Invalid URL blocks all database operations
- **Source:** Supabase production instance settings
- **Vercel Scope:** Production, Preview (optional), Development (optional)

**2. DIRECT_URL** (HIGH SECURITY)
- **Purpose:** Direct PostgreSQL connection for schema migrations (bypasses pgBouncer)
- **Format:** `postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]`
- **Risk:** CRITICAL - Required for `prisma db push` operations
- **Source:** Supabase production instance settings
- **Vercel Scope:** Production only (migrations run pre-deployment)

**3. NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL** (PUBLIC - Safe for browser)
- **Purpose:** Supabase API endpoint for client-side auth/database calls
- **Format:** `https://npylfibbutxioxjtcbvy.supabase.co`
- **Risk:** LOW - Public URL, safe to expose
- **Source:** Vision document (already provided)
- **Vercel Scope:** Production, Preview, Development

**4. NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY** (PUBLIC - Safe for browser)
- **Purpose:** Anonymous access key for client-side Supabase SDK
- **Format:** JWT token (provided in vision)
- **Risk:** LOW - Designed for client exposure, RLS enforces security
- **Source:** Vision document (already provided)
- **Vercel Scope:** Production, Preview, Development

**5. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY** (CRITICAL SECURITY)
- **Purpose:** Server-side admin access for bypassing RLS (admin user creation)
- **Format:** JWT token (provided in vision)
- **Risk:** CRITICAL - Full database access, NEVER expose to client
- **Source:** Vision document (already provided)
- **Vercel Scope:** Production only, server-side functions only
- **Security:** Must NEVER be in NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables

**6. CRON_SECRET** (HIGH SECURITY)
- **Purpose:** Authenticates Vercel Cron requests to recurring transaction endpoint
- **Format:** 64-character hex string
- **Risk:** HIGH - Prevents unauthorized cron job triggering
- **Source:** Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`
- **Vercel Scope:** Production only
- **Security:** Used in Authorization header validation

**7. ENCRYPTION_KEY** (CONDITIONAL - Required if Plaid enabled)
- **Purpose:** Encrypts Plaid access tokens in database
- **Format:** 64-character hex string
- **Risk:** HIGH if Plaid enabled - Cannot decrypt tokens without it
- **Source:** Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`
- **Vercel Scope:** Production (if Plaid used)
- **Note:** Optional for MVP if Plaid not used initially

### Optional Variables (Post-MVP)

**PLAID_CLIENT_ID, PLAID_SECRET, PLAID_ENV**
- **Purpose:** Bank account integration via Plaid
- **Risk:** MEDIUM - External API dependency
- **Note:** 9 Plaid-related files exist in codebase (integration ready but not required for MVP)

**ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**
- **Purpose:** AI-powered transaction categorization
- **Risk:** LOW - Graceful degradation if not present
- **Note:** Already integrated (@anthropic-ai/sdk@0.32.1 dependency)

**GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET**
- **Purpose:** OAuth login via Google
- **Risk:** LOW - Email/password auth works without it
- **Note:** Supabase auth supports OAuth providers

**RESEND_API_KEY**
- **Purpose:** Email sending via Resend service
- **Risk:** LOW - Supabase has built-in email sending
- **Note:** Alternative to Supabase email system

---

## Critical Path Analysis

### Iteration 1: Currency Migration (FOUNDATION)
**Must Complete First:** Code changes don't depend on infrastructure

- Update `src/lib/constants.ts`: CURRENCY_CODE = "NIS", CURRENCY_SYMBOL = "₪"
- Update `src/lib/utils.ts`: formatCurrency() to use NIS formatting
- Update all 55+ files calling formatCurrency() to position ₪ after amount
- Update prisma/schema.prisma: currency defaults to "NIS"
- Update test files with new expected NIS values
- Update seed scripts to use NIS currency

**Blocks:** GitHub commit, Vercel deployment, all downstream phases

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 hours

**Risk:** LOW - USD-only system already exists, just replacing USD → NIS

---

### Iteration 2: Infrastructure Setup (DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE)
**Depends On:** Iteration 1 complete (currency code ready)

**2A: GitHub Integration**
- Commit all currency migration changes
- Push to main branch
- Verify repository status

**2B: Vercel Configuration**
- Create/link Vercel project to GitHub repo
- Configure all 7 environment variables
- Enable automatic deployments on main push
- Enable preview deployments for branches
- Verify vercel.json cron configuration

**2C: Supabase Production Setup**
- Run database migrations: `npx prisma db push` (requires DIRECT_URL)
- Enable email verification in Supabase auth settings
- Create custom HTML email templates (confirmation, password reset)
- Deploy templates to Supabase dashboard
- Create admin user with pre-verified email

**Blocks:** Production deployment, production app functionality

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 hours

**Risk:** MEDIUM - Environment variable misconfiguration likely

---

### Iteration 3: Deployment & Verification (LAUNCH)
**Depends On:** Iteration 2 complete (infrastructure ready)

**3A: Initial Deployment**
- Trigger Vercel build (auto-deploys from GitHub push)
- Monitor build logs for errors
- Verify deployment success
- Note production URL

**3B: Production Testing**
- Test admin login (ahiya.butman@gmail.com / wealth_generator)
- Create test transaction, verify NIS display
- Test email verification flow (new user signup)
- Verify all pages render correctly
- Test cron job endpoint manually
- Verify RLS policies working

**Blocks:** Production launch approval

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours

**Risk:** LOW - Verification only, can rollback if issues found

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

**Risk 1: Environment Variable Misconfiguration**
- **Description:** Invalid DATABASE_URL, missing CRON_SECRET, or exposed SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- **Impact:** Build failures, runtime errors, security vulnerabilities, or complete deployment failure
- **Probability:** HIGH (60% chance of initial misconfiguration)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use Vercel preview environment to test env vars before production
  - Verify each variable format against .env.example template
  - Test database connection with `npx prisma db push` locally first
  - Never prefix SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY with NEXT_PUBLIC_
  - Generate CRON_SECRET with exact command: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- **Rollback:** Update env vars in Vercel dashboard, redeploy automatically
- **Recommendation:** Tackle in Iteration 2B with checklist validation

**Risk 2: Database Migration Failure on Production**
- **Description:** Prisma migrations fail to execute on production Supabase instance
- **Impact:** App cannot start, no data persistence, production deployment blocked
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (40% chance of connection/permission issues)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test migration locally against production DB first (from dev machine)
  - Verify DIRECT_URL bypasses pgBouncer (direct connection required)
  - Ensure Supabase production instance is accessible (IP whitelisting?)
  - Run `npx prisma db push` manually before Vercel deployment
  - Keep local dev environment as rollback database
- **Rollback:** Re-run migrations, check connection string format, verify Supabase access
- **Recommendation:** Run migrations in Iteration 2C before Vercel deployment

**Risk 3: Email Verification System Failure**
- **Description:** Supabase email sending not configured, templates not applied, or SMTP blocked
- **Impact:** New users cannot verify email, cannot access app (blocks onboarding)
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (35% chance if email sending not pre-configured)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Verify Supabase email sending is enabled in project settings
  - Test email delivery with Supabase built-in SMTP first
  - Create and upload custom HTML templates to Supabase dashboard
  - Send test verification email before production launch
  - Ensure admin user is pre-verified (bypass verification for initial access)
- **Fallback:** Disable email verification temporarily via Supabase settings
- **Recommendation:** Test email system in Iteration 2C, after infrastructure setup

**Risk 4: Cron Job Not Triggering (Recurring Transactions)**
- **Description:** Vercel cron not configured, CRON_SECRET mismatch, or endpoint unreachable
- **Impact:** Recurring transactions not auto-generated daily (manual workaround needed)
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (30% chance of initial cron misconfiguration)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Verify vercel.json is committed to repository root
  - Ensure CRON_SECRET is set in Vercel environment variables
  - Test cron endpoint manually with curl after deployment
  - Check Vercel dashboard for cron job visibility
  - Monitor Vercel function logs for cron execution
- **Fallback:** Use external cron service (cron-job.org) or manual trigger
- **Recommendation:** Verify in Iteration 3B during production testing

---

### Medium Risks

**Risk 5: Currency Symbol Positioning Inconsistencies**
- **Description:** Some components show "₪ 1,234.56" instead of "1,234.56 ₪"
- **Impact:** Poor UX, inconsistent branding, user confusion
- **Probability:** MEDIUM (30% chance of missing edge cases in 55+ files)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Centralize formatting in formatCurrency() utility (already done)
  - Visual inspection of all pages during testing
  - Create checklist of all currency display locations (forms, charts, cards, exports)
  - Test CSV/JSON exports to verify NIS currency
- **Rollback:** CSS fix or formatCurrency() adjustment, redeploy
- **Recommendation:** Thorough testing in Iteration 3B

**Risk 6: Plaid Integration Currency Mismatch**
- **Description:** Plaid expects USD but app now uses NIS (conversion needed?)
- **Impact:** Bank sync transactions display incorrect amounts or fail to import
- **Probability:** LOW-MEDIUM (25% if Plaid used, 0% if not used in MVP)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Document that Plaid integration expects US-based bank accounts only
  - Add validation to reject non-USD Plaid accounts
  - Consider disabling Plaid for NIS-only MVP
  - Future: Add currency conversion layer for international Plaid accounts
- **Fallback:** Disable Plaid integration, use manual accounts only
- **Recommendation:** Clarify Plaid usage in MVP scope (likely exclude for NIS deployment)

**Risk 7: Build Timeout on Vercel Free Tier**
- **Description:** Next.js build exceeds 10-second function timeout limit
- **Impact:** Deployment fails, app unavailable
- **Probability:** LOW (15% chance - typical Next.js build is fast)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Monitor build duration in Vercel logs
  - Optimize dependencies if build time increases
  - Consider Vercel Pro ($20/month) for 60s timeout if needed
- **Fallback:** Upgrade to Vercel Pro tier
- **Recommendation:** Monitor during Iteration 3A initial deployment

---

### Low Risks

**Risk 8: GitHub Auto-Deployment Not Triggering**
- **Description:** Push to main doesn't trigger Vercel deployment
- **Impact:** Manual deployment needed (minor inconvenience)
- **Probability:** LOW (10% - Vercel-GitHub integration is mature)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Verify Vercel project is connected to correct GitHub repo
  - Check GitHub webhook configuration in Vercel settings
  - Enable automatic deployments explicitly in Vercel dashboard
- **Fallback:** Deploy manually via Vercel CLI: `vercel --prod`
- **Recommendation:** Verify in Iteration 2B during Vercel setup

**Risk 9: Next.js Production Build Errors**
- **Description:** TypeScript errors, missing dependencies, or build failures
- **Impact:** Deployment blocked until errors fixed
- **Probability:** LOW (10% - existing codebase already builds successfully)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Run `npm run build` locally before pushing to GitHub
  - Run `npm run lint` to catch TypeScript errors
  - Verify all dependencies are in package.json (no dev-only imports in prod)
- **Rollback:** Fix errors, commit, push again (auto-redeploys)
- **Recommendation:** Pre-deployment verification in Iteration 1

**Risk 10: Admin User Creation Fails**
- **Description:** SQL script fails, Supabase dashboard error, or password policy issues
- **Impact:** Cannot login to production app initially
- **Probability:** LOW (10% - multiple creation methods available)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use Supabase dashboard method (most reliable)
  - Fallback to SQL script in Supabase SQL editor
  - Ensure password "wealth_generator" meets Supabase policies (8+ chars)
  - Pre-verify email to bypass verification requirement
- **Fallback:** Create user via signup flow and manually verify in Supabase
- **Recommendation:** Use dashboard method in Iteration 2C

---

## Dependency Recommendations for Master Plan

### 1. **Iteration Breakdown: MULTI-ITERATION (3 phases)**

**Recommendation:** Split into 3 focused iterations to isolate risks and enable incremental validation.

**Iteration 1: Currency Migration (Foundation)**
- **Duration:** 3-4 hours
- **Risk:** LOW
- **Why First:** No external dependencies, establishes NIS foundation, must complete before deployment
- **Success Criteria:** All currency displays show "X,XXX.XX ₪" format, tests pass

**Iteration 2: Infrastructure Setup (Deployment Pipeline)**
- **Duration:** 3-4 hours
- **Risk:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Why Second:** Requires currency changes committed, sets up production environment
- **Success Criteria:** Vercel connected, env vars configured, database migrated, admin user created

**Iteration 3: Deployment & Verification (Launch)**
- **Duration:** 2-3 hours
- **Risk:** LOW-MEDIUM
- **Why Third:** Requires all infrastructure ready, final validation before production launch
- **Success Criteria:** App accessible via Vercel URL, admin login works, transactions persist

---

### 2. **Critical Dependencies to Address First**

**Priority 1 (CRITICAL - Block everything):**
- Currency code migration (55+ files)
- Environment variable preparation (generate CRON_SECRET, gather Supabase credentials)

**Priority 2 (HIGH - Block deployment):**
- GitHub repository sync
- Vercel project creation and GitHub connection
- Database migration execution

**Priority 3 (MEDIUM - Block production functionality):**
- Email verification setup
- Admin user creation
- Cron job configuration

**Priority 4 (LOW - Polish):**
- Email template customization
- Production testing and verification

---

### 3. **Risk Mitigation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation**
- Run `npm run build` locally to catch build errors
- Run `npm run lint` to catch TypeScript issues
- Test database migrations against production DB from local machine
- Verify all env vars gathered and formatted correctly

**Phase 2: Progressive Deployment**
- Use Vercel preview environment first (deploy to non-production URL)
- Test all functionality in preview before promoting to production
- Keep local dev environment running as fallback

**Phase 3: Monitoring & Rollback Plan**
- Monitor Vercel deployment logs in real-time
- Test critical paths immediately after deployment (login, transaction creation)
- If issues found, can rollback via Vercel dashboard (previous deployment)
- Environment variable changes take effect immediately (no redeploy needed)

---

### 4. **External Service Coordination**

**GitHub → Vercel Integration:**
- Must connect Vercel to GitHub repo before first deployment
- Automatic deployments enabled by default once connected
- Preview deployments recommended for safety

**Vercel → Supabase Integration:**
- Vercel needs Supabase credentials as environment variables
- Database must be migrated before first app start
- Connection pooling handled by Supabase pgBouncer

**Supabase → Email Provider:**
- Supabase has built-in email sending (verify enabled)
- Alternative: Configure SMTP credentials in Supabase settings
- Email templates uploaded via Supabase dashboard

---

## Technology Stack Implications

### Production Infrastructure

**Hosting Platform: Vercel**
- **Strengths:** Excellent Next.js support, automatic HTTPS, global CDN, easy env var management
- **Constraints:** 10s function timeout on free tier (60s on Pro), serverless architecture
- **Cost:** Free tier sufficient for MVP (unlimited deployments, cron jobs included)

**Database: Supabase PostgreSQL**
- **Strengths:** Managed PostgreSQL, built-in auth, RLS security, connection pooling
- **Constraints:** Connection limits (check Supabase plan), direct connection needed for migrations
- **Cost:** Free tier sufficient for MVP (500MB database, 50K monthly active users)

**Authentication: Supabase Auth**
- **Strengths:** Built-in email verification, OAuth providers, session management, RLS integration
- **Constraints:** Email sending limits on free tier, SMTP configuration may be needed
- **Cost:** Free tier sufficient for MVP

---

### Build & Deployment Pipeline

**Current Stack:**
- Next.js 14.2.33 (App Router, Server Components)
- TypeScript 5.7.2 (type safety)
- Prisma 5.22.0 (database ORM)
- tRPC 11.6.0 (type-safe API)
- TailwindCSS 3.4.1 (styling)

**Build Requirements:**
- Node.js runtime (Vercel provides)
- Prisma client generation during build
- Environment variables available at build time (NEXT_PUBLIC_*)
- vercel.json for cron configuration

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Push to main → Vercel auto-builds → Deploys if successful
- Preview deployments for branches (test before merging)
- Rollback available via Vercel dashboard

---

## Integration Considerations

### Cross-Phase Integration Points

**1. Currency Formatting Standard**
- **Shared Component:** formatCurrency() utility in src/lib/utils.ts
- **Spans:** All iterations (used everywhere)
- **Consistency Needed:** NIS symbol position (after amount), 2 decimal places, comma thousands separator
- **Why It Matters:** Single source of truth prevents formatting inconsistencies

**2. Environment Variable Dependencies**
- **Shared Pattern:** All services read from process.env
- **Spans:** Vercel setup (Iteration 2), Supabase connection (Iteration 2), Cron jobs (Iteration 3)
- **Consistency Needed:** Variable naming (NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-safe vars)
- **Why It Matters:** Incorrect env var scope can expose secrets or cause runtime errors

**3. Database Schema State**
- **Shared Component:** Prisma schema and migrations
- **Spans:** Local dev (Iteration 1), Production setup (Iteration 2)
- **Consistency Needed:** Schema must match between local and production
- **Why It Matters:** Migration failures if schemas drift

---

### Potential Integration Challenges

**Challenge 1: Currency Migration Completeness**
- **Issue:** Easy to miss currency references in edge case components (exports, charts, emails)
- **Impact:** Inconsistent UX, some amounts show USD instead of NIS
- **Solution:** Create comprehensive checklist of all currency display locations, visual testing

**Challenge 2: Environment Variable Propagation**
- **Issue:** Env vars must be set in multiple places (local .env, Vercel dashboard, CI/CD)
- **Impact:** "Works on my machine" syndrome, production failures
- **Solution:** Use .env.example as single source of truth, validate env vars on app start

**Challenge 3: Database Migration Timing**
- **Issue:** Migrations must run before app starts, but Vercel builds before runtime
- **Impact:** App crashes on first request if schema doesn't match Prisma client
- **Solution:** Run migrations manually before first deployment, consider adding migration step to build

**Challenge 4: Supabase Auth vs. Prisma User Model**
- **Issue:** Users exist in both Supabase Auth and Prisma User table (dual state)
- **Impact:** Sync issues if user created in one but not the other
- **Solution:** Admin user creation must handle both (scripts/create-test-user.ts pattern)

---

## Notes & Observations

### Existing USD-Only Implementation

The codebase has already completed a major currency simplification (USD_ONLY_IMPLEMENTATION.md):
- Removed multi-currency support (~2000 lines of code)
- Removed ExchangeRate and CurrencyConversionLog models
- Removed currency conversion services and APIs
- Removed currency selector UI components

**Implication:** Currency migration from USD to NIS is SIMPLER than initially expected. The hardcoded "USD" values just need to be replaced with "NIS", no complex conversion logic needed.

**Risk Reduction:** LOW complexity for currency changes (just string replacements + formatting)

---

### Recurring Transactions Feature

The codebase has a fully implemented recurring transactions system:
- RecurringTransaction model in database
- Cron job endpoint: /api/cron/generate-recurring
- vercel.json configured for daily execution at 2 AM
- CRON_SECRET authentication required

**Implication:** Cron job is MVP-critical (not optional), must be tested in production.

**Dependency:** CRON_SECRET must be generated and configured in Vercel environment variables.

---

### Plaid Integration Considerations

The app has Plaid integration code (9 files) but it's OPTIONAL:
- Requires PLAID_CLIENT_ID, PLAID_SECRET, ENCRYPTION_KEY
- Expects US-based bank accounts (CountryCode.Us)
- Already enforces USD currency (no conversion needed)

**Recommendation for NIS MVP:** EXCLUDE Plaid integration initially
- Plaid primarily supports US/Canadian banks
- Israeli banks not in Plaid ecosystem
- Manual account creation sufficient for personal use
- Can add Israeli bank integrations later (different API)

**Risk Mitigation:** Remove PLAID_* and ENCRYPTION_KEY from required env vars for MVP.

---

### Email Verification Templates

Vision specifies custom branded email templates as MVP requirement:
- Confirmation email (signup verification)
- Password reset email
- Magic link email (optional)

**Challenge:** Supabase email template customization has limited flexibility:
- Templates configured via Supabase dashboard or CLI
- Inline CSS required (most email clients strip <style> tags)
- Logo must be hosted externally or base64 embedded

**Recommendation:** Start with simple templates for MVP, enhance post-launch
- Use Supabase default templates initially (works out of box)
- Customize branding (colors, logo) in Iteration 2C
- Advanced templates can be post-MVP enhancement

---

### Admin User Password Security

Vision specifies hardcoded password: "wealth_generator"

**Security Concern:** Password is documented in vision (not secret)

**Recommendation:** Change password after first login
- Initial password allows immediate access
- User can change password via settings page
- Consider adding "force password change on first login" logic post-MVP

**Risk:** LOW for personal use app, MEDIUM if multi-user deployment

---

### Testing & Quality Assurance

Existing test infrastructure:
- Vitest configured (vitest.config.ts)
- Test files exist for routers, services
- Coverage tracking available (npm run test:coverage)

**Gap:** No tests for currency formatting (formatCurrency utility not tested)

**Recommendation:** Add currency formatting tests before deployment
- Test NIS symbol positioning
- Test decimal precision
- Test thousands separator
- Prevents regression during migration

**Risk Mitigation:** Catch currency bugs early in Iteration 1

---

### Database Backup Strategy

Vision mentions "database backup strategy documented" as acceptance criteria.

**Current State:** No automated backup system configured

**Recommendation:** Document manual backup procedure for MVP
- Supabase provides point-in-time recovery on paid plans
- Free tier: Manual exports via Supabase dashboard
- Consider upgrading to Supabase Pro for automated backups ($25/month)

**Risk:** MEDIUM - Data loss possible without backups
**Mitigation:** Export database weekly during MVP testing phase

---

## Recommendations for Master Planner

### 1. **Start with Iteration 1 (Currency Migration) Immediately**
- No external dependencies, can start work right away
- Establishes foundation for all subsequent work
- Low risk, high value (makes app NIS-native)
- Estimated 3-4 hours (single focused builder)

### 2. **Parallelize Infrastructure Preparation During Iteration 1**
- While currency migration happens, prepare environment variables
- Generate CRON_SECRET and ENCRYPTION_KEY (if needed)
- Verify Supabase production instance is accessible
- Create Vercel account and link GitHub repository
- This saves time and unblocks Iteration 2

### 3. **Treat Iteration 2 as High-Risk, Allocate Extra Time**
- Infrastructure setup is where most failures occur
- Budget 4-5 hours instead of 3-4 hours
- Consider splitting into sub-iterations:
  - 2A: GitHub integration (30 min)
  - 2B: Vercel configuration (2 hours)
  - 2C: Supabase production setup (2 hours)
- Validate each sub-iteration before moving forward

### 4. **Use Vercel Preview Environment for Iteration 2 Testing**
- Don't deploy directly to production first time
- Deploy to preview URL, test thoroughly
- Promotes to production only after validation
- Reduces production deployment risk significantly

### 5. **Create Pre-Flight Checklist for Iteration 3**
Before final production deployment, verify:
- [ ] All env vars configured correctly in Vercel
- [ ] Database migrations executed successfully
- [ ] Admin user created and verified
- [ ] Local build succeeds (npm run build)
- [ ] Preview deployment tested and working
- [ ] Email verification tested (send test email)
- [ ] Cron endpoint tested manually

### 6. **Document Rollback Procedures**
For each iteration, define rollback plan:
- **Iteration 1:** Git revert commits (local only, no infrastructure impact)
- **Iteration 2:** Delete Vercel project, revert GitHub changes
- **Iteration 3:** Rollback deployment via Vercel dashboard, restore previous version

### 7. **Exclude Plaid from MVP Scope**
- Plaid integration is US-centric (not suitable for NIS/Israeli banks)
- Adds complexity without value for personal use
- Manual account creation is sufficient
- Can add Israeli bank integrations post-MVP (different API providers)
- **Action:** Mark PLAID_*, ENCRYPTION_KEY as optional in env var checklist

### 8. **Prioritize Email Verification Testing**
- Email verification is user-blocking (can't access app without it)
- Test email delivery early in Iteration 2C
- Have fallback plan (disable verification temporarily if email fails)
- Verify admin user is pre-verified (bypass requirement)

---

## Timeline Estimates

**Optimistic Scenario (No Issues):** 8-10 hours total
- Iteration 1: 3 hours (currency migration)
- Iteration 2: 3 hours (infrastructure setup)
- Iteration 3: 2 hours (deployment & testing)

**Realistic Scenario (Minor Issues):** 10-12 hours total
- Iteration 1: 4 hours (edge cases in currency formatting)
- Iteration 2: 4 hours (env var troubleshooting, database migration retries)
- Iteration 3: 3 hours (thorough testing, email verification debugging)

**Pessimistic Scenario (Major Issues):** 14-16 hours total
- Iteration 1: 5 hours (extensive testing, missed currency references)
- Iteration 2: 6 hours (Supabase connection issues, email setup problems)
- Iteration 3: 4 hours (production debugging, rollback and retry)

**Recommendation:** Plan for Realistic Scenario (10-12 hours), buffer for Pessimistic

---

## Success Criteria Validation

From vision document, MVP is successful when:
