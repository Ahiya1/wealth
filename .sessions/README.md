# .sessions - 1.5L Session-Based Development

## What is this?

This directory contains the **session plan** and **session reports** for transforming Wealth from a good foundation (7/10) to a bulletproof production-ready system (10/10).

## The 1.5L Pattern

**1.5L** stands for "1.5 Layers" - a development pattern that emphasizes:
1. **Planning first** - Comprehensive exploration before writing code
2. **Session-based work** - Focused, completable chunks
3. **Perfect completion** - Each session is 100% done before moving on
4. **Detailed reporting** - Document everything for future reference
5. **No half-measures** - Quality over speed

## Directory Structure

```
.sessions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plan.md                      # Master plan with all 8 sessions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session-1-report.md          # Report after Session 1 completes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session-2-report.md          # Report after Session 2 completes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                          # And so on
```

## How Sessions Work

### Before Starting a Session
1. Read `plan.md` carefully
2. Understand the session goals
3. Check dependencies (some sessions require others)
4. Set aside focused time (3-5 hours)

### During a Session
1. Follow the tasks in order
2. Check off each task as completed
3. Don't skip anything
4. If something is impossible, document why
5. Keep notes for the report

### After Completing a Session
1. Write a detailed report in `session-N-report.md`
2. Include:
   - What was accomplished
   - What changed from the plan
   - Metrics/results (test coverage, performance, etc.)
   - Code samples of key improvements
   - Challenges encountered
   - Recommendations for future sessions
3. Update the checklist in `plan.md`
4. Commit everything with clear message
5. Take a break! üéâ

## Session Report Template

```markdown
# Session N: [Session Name]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration**: X hours
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete / ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial / ‚ùå Blocked

## Goals
- [List of goals from plan.md]

## What Was Accomplished
- Detailed list of what was done
- Include metrics (e.g., "Added 23 real tests, coverage now 87%")

## Changes from Plan
- What deviated from original plan and why

## Key Improvements
### Code Example 1
\`\`\`typescript
// Before
// ... bad code

// After
// ... good code
\`\`\`

### Metrics Before/After
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Test Coverage | 10% | 87% | +77% |
| Type Safety | 60 `any` | 0 `any` | -60 |

## Challenges Encountered
- Challenge 1 and how it was solved
- Challenge 2 and how it was solved

## Recommendations for Next Sessions
- Insight 1
- Insight 2

## Files Changed
- `path/to/file1.ts` - What changed
- `path/to/file2.ts` - What changed

## Next Steps
- What should be done in the next session
- Any dependencies this session created

**Session completed by**: [Your name]
**Reviewed by**: [If applicable]
```

## Rules

### The Iron Rules (Never Break These)
1. ‚úÖ **Never mark a session complete if tasks remain**
2. ‚úÖ **Always write the session report**
3. ‚úÖ **Always run tests before marking complete**
4. ‚úÖ **Always commit working code, never broken code**
5. ‚úÖ **Document everything - future you will thank present you**

### The Quality Standards
- Code must be production-ready
- Tests must actually test things
- Documentation must be complete
- No shortcuts, no "TODO later"

### The Flexibility Clause
- If a session is too large, split it
- If you discover new issues, add them to the plan
- If priorities change, reorder sessions (document why)
- If blocked, document and skip to next independent session

## FAQ

**Q: What if I can't complete a session in one sitting?**
A: That's fine! Just don't mark it complete until ALL tasks are done. You can pause and resume.

**Q: What if I find the plan is wrong?**
A: Update the plan! Document what changed and why in the session report.

**Q: Can I do sessions in a different order?**
A: Sessions 1-3 should be done in order (they're HIGH PRIORITY). Sessions 4-6 can be done in any order. Session 7 requires most of 1-6. Session 8 requires ALL previous sessions.

**Q: What if I find bugs or issues not in the plan?**
A: Add them to the current session if related, or create a new session in the plan.

**Q: How detailed should the reports be?**
A: Very detailed! Think of them as documentation for someone else (or future you) trying to understand what happened and why.

## Benefits of This Pattern

1. **Measurable Progress** - Clear before/after metrics
2. **No Surprises** - Everything is documented
3. **Quality Assurance** - Nothing is half-done
4. **Knowledge Transfer** - Reports serve as documentation
5. **Confidence** - Know exactly what's complete and what's not
6. **Maintainability** - Future developers can understand the evolution

## Current Status

See `plan.md` for the session status tracker and detailed plan.
